# Demoboard status ledger

Last updated: 2026-08-06

Status: **implementation in progress; D0/D1/D2/D3 measured partial**.

This is the first file a worker updates after completing the mandatory reading
order. It reports evidence; it does not turn an unavailable parent capability
into a local implementation task.

## Milestones

| Slice | State | Current evidence | Blocker/next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEMO-D0 package/consumer proof | measured partial | opt-in native target; immutable catalogue 001/generation 86; independent product/controller roots in one owned native application session; installed `GUIForms::Controls` consumer; public-boundary and AppKit lifecycle tests | installed native host target remains open |
| DEMO-D1 shell/material | measured partial | exact 1450×850 six-band geometry test; Sapphire/House shell; split workspace; native AppKit capture under `results/2026-08-06-d1-shell/` | custom host chrome, exact reference-size capture, responsive matrix, and reusable gradient/material roles remain open |

| DEMO-D4 path matrix | not started | exact fixture and state machine | requires breadcrumb/editor/popup/suggestion primitives |
| DEMO-D5 Search correspondence | not started | seven-result fixture and geometry | requires variable-height virtualization/inspection expansion |
| DEMO-D6 Criteria virtual folder | not started | three-module fixture | requires editable choice/property/rack composition |
| DEMO-D7 transfer/operations | not started | operation scenarios | outbound drag and operation surfaces remain parent work |
| DEMO-D8 accessibility/accommodation | not started | semantic requirements | native publishers and text ranges remain parent work |
| DEMO-D9 review laboratories | not started | copied atlas content | follows default daily-surface material proof |
| DEMO-D10 closure | not started | acceptance matrix | follows D0–D9 evidence |

Allowed states: `not started`, `in progress`, `blocked by <FM-ID>`, `measured
partial`, `complete`. Use `complete` only when the slice's exit and applicable
acceptance gates pass.

## Current capability posture

The parent GUI.Forms project currently proves a retained kernel, damage,
display chunks, a native AppKit/Win32 proving host subset, basic/container/range
controls, PNG resources, Unicode text-store/grapheme foundations, and
experimental ABIs. This summary is informational and can become stale; the
worker must inspect the parent capability report and relevant milestone evidence
before changing a row.

| Consumer area | Initial posture | Required recording |
|---|---|---|
| stable shell/layout | partial | exact public controls and missing FM-W/FM-LY IDs |
| House drawing/material | partial | admitted FM-R operations and explicit fallback/unavailable states |
| commands/ribbon/menu | partial | public `Command`/`CommandBinding`, tokenized window accelerators, retained `MenuStrip`, and `ContextMenu` cover shared state, top-level switching, disabled reasons, checks/radios, nested submenus, keyboard focus, click-away, scrolling, edge avoidance, and native semantics; split commands, key tips, and responsive ribbon overflow remain open |
| breadcrumb/path editor | partial | clickable retained breadcrumb segments project one navigation authority; editable path mode, suggestions, validation and popup matrix remain FM-N open work |
| virtual tree/object views | partial | public stable-ID tree/object controls, model-order multi-selection, primary/anchor/independent focus, keyboard/type select, icon/details/sort preservation, context requests, and bounded visible semantic children; provider-scale and inline label editing remain open |
| selection PropertyList/preview host | measured partial | public grouped `PropertyList`, stable stock editors, validation, choice commits, preview header/disclosure, one-scroll-plane ownership, split-pane collapse/restore, native semantic/edit evidence; async commit/reset/default/custom editors remain open |
| correspondence rows | open | FM-C09/C10, FM-S01, FM-LY08 |
| criteria rack | open | FM-S02/S03 and public editor/choice composition |
| outbound drag/external peer | open | FM-D IDs; inbound proof is not outbound proof |
| native accessibility | open | FM-A IDs and physical publisher results |
| HarfBuzz/FreeType/bundled body fonts | measured partial | the refreshed 349-codepoint Portsmouth Rapids regular/bold faces contain `U+2190 U+2191 U+2192 U+25BC`; HarfBuzz tests prove the full navigation string shapes in one Rapids run at regular and bold weights; Carlito/Noto remain explicit resilience and mixed-script fallback; revised-face scale/raster acceptance remains open |
| motion/sounds | measured partial | public `SemanticFeedback` records deterministic location/pane/option/operation events through an injected monotonic clock; sound-off preserves the semantic trace with zero host gain; Window reduced motion keeps progress/easing activity live at calmer cadence; physical host cue assets/coalescing remain open |

## Evidence locations to create

When implementation begins, create evidence beneath this project so the
standalone consumer can be audited without searching temporary build output:

```text
results/
  <date>-d0-consumer/
  <date>-d1-shell/
  <date>-d2-folder/
  <date>-d3-responsive/
  <date>-d4-path-matrix/
  <date>-d5-search/
  <date>-d6-criteria/
  <date>-d7-transfer/
  <date>-d8-accessibility/
  <date>-d9-review-boards/
  <date>-d10-closure/
```

Each evidence directory contains, as applicable:

- `README.md` with revision, environment, claim, and inference boundary;
- command/test output;
- headless layout/input/command/semantic traces;
- capability report;
- native screenshots and capture manifest;
- damage/layout/text/resource measurements;
- host/symbol/include boundary audits;
- accessibility notes;
- failures and negative results.

Do not check in generated build trees, transient caches, or unbounded logs.

## Present evidence

- frozen atlas source and four historical screenshots under `reference/`;
- SHA-256 manifest and correction ledger in `reference/README.md`;
- detailed project, visual, control, interaction, fixture, implementation, and
  acceptance specifications;
- native product-shell executable, headless geometry/fixture/semantic tests,
  public-source boundary policy, installed-controls consumer proof, and first
  AppKit capture now exist;
- the separate controller retained tree now runs beside the product as an owned
  native tool window with independent close/lifetime/accessibility roots;
- public TreeView, multi-select ObjectView, shared Command/CommandBinding,
  tokenized accelerators, retained MenuStrip, and ContextMenu primitives now replace the former Folder-mode
  presentation-only compositions;
- physical AppKit evidence records an object menu plus nested checked submenu,
  and preserves the initial accessible-but-invisible popup failure and its
  window-owned overlay-root correction;
- refreshed Portsmouth Rapids regular/bold faces contain the requested
  navigation/disclosure glyphs and pass one-run HarfBuzz shaping at both weights.
- physical AppKit dogfood records top-level keyboard menu switching, a nested
  Move / copy submenu, Up navigation to Work, and Back restoration of the exact
  Projects selection; headless tests cover Back/Forward/Up branch semantics.
- D3 physical AppKit dogfood records F2 Name editing through commit, coherent
  object/heading/property projection, complete removal of the collapsed
  Selection subtree from accessibility order, and remembered-extent restore;
  public and installed-consumer tests cover validation, choice commits,
  disclosures, one-scroll ownership, and seam pointer/keyboard/semantic paths.
