# Private Unicode line-break dependency intake

**OBSERVED source:** libunibreak 8.0, tag `libunibreak_8_0`, commit
`28a2756b864c343f438cd22537d49d394d4666a5`, from
<https://github.com/adah1972/libunibreak>. Upstream NEWS and source identify
Unicode 17.0, UAX #14 revision 55. The supplied LineBreakTest header identifies
17.0.0. Retain the upstream `LICENCE` and Unicode data notices, with the existing
Unicode license in `third_party/unicode/LICENSE.txt`. No vendor source is edited
or claimed to meet the first-party coding style.

**MEASURED:** coordinator compiled the untouched upstream nine library C files
and `tests.c` with GCC 16.2, C99, `-O2 -Wall -Wextra` on Shadow Windows. Supplied
line conformance passed **19,338/19,338**, word **1,944/1,944**, grapheme
**766/766**, with no skips. `test_skips.h` contains only terminators. An upstream
unused-variable warning in `tests.c` is retained; no vendor patch was applied.
These are conformance results, not a throughput benchmark or proof of the new
wrapping adapter. Intake source and executable are under
`.build/libunibreak-8.0-intake/`.

**OBSERVED API/storage review:** `set_linebreaks_utf8` writes one byte per input
byte to caller-owned output. Decisions describe breaks after code-point-ending
bytes; interior bytes carry `LINEBREAK_INSIDEACHAR`. Use `"-strict"` for the
tested default Unicode behavior, independent of host locale. End-of-input
`LINEBREAK_INDETERMINATE` needs explicit adapter interpretation. The input is
validated UTF-8, at most 16 KiB, and the output belongs to charged worker storage.
The production source has no heap allocation calls; its line-break state is
local and property/action tables are static. `init_linebreak` is a no-op.
The wrapper must preserve LF/CRLF/source offsets and intersect legal boundaries
with extended graphemes and actual shaping clusters. This library does not
choose widths, fonts, bidi order, hyphenation, ellipsis or dictionary services.

**OBSERVED coordinator acceptance:** admit this pinned private dependency for
the already assigned development text-mask profile. A first-party UAX #14 rewrite
would add algorithm/table maintenance without a demonstrated need; existing
whitespace-only wrapping cannot meet that profile. This is a reversible private
dependency choice, not a new public API, installed SDK promise or global ADR.
Keep it out of normal OFF builds. First-party fetch/build/adapter code receives
house-style review; upstream code and data retain their original licenses.

`fetch_linebreak.sh` fetches the exact commit and refuses an unexpected origin,
modified checkout or non-repository destination. Unlike the general text-stack
fetch, it is explicitly requested only for the development mask build. Initial
manual invocation with an incomplete MSYS PATH exposed a nested `dirname`
failure: the script incorrectly resolved to the working directory. The script
now resolves its parent in a separate checked assignment. The newly fetched
checkout was verified and moved to the exact intended `third_party/libunibreak`
path; no user data was removed. The two local Git implementations also disagreed
on inherited CRLF policy; an explicit matching local Git setting resolved that
false dirty report. Normal MSYS CI uses one Git/tool environment throughout.

The corrected script passed `bash -n`, idempotent exact-pin fetch and a deliberate
missing-`dirname` PATH check: it failed before creating any destination. Its
authored scope was reviewed for named steps, failure ordering, quoting, origin/
revision verification and preservation of existing modifications under the
language-neutral house style. The vendor tests and sources remain upstream code.
