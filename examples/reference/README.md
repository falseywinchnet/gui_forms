Configure this directory with the installed GUI.Forms prefix and the provider's
LLVM 22 toolchain file, then build and run CTest. These examples use exported
targets rather than private source-tree includes or archives.

`cooperative_worker` links Threading alone. `audio_worker.cpp` is a static adapter
that links only Audio. Its named Worker entry borrows the context and passes the
entry's CancellationFlag straight to `AudioClip::load_ogg`. A small atomic gate
makes cancellation before decode deterministic; `join` publishes the result
before the caller reads it. The normal successful decode first verifies the
input. `ogg_worker` exercises the adapter without Core, and
`application_audio_worker` uses the same adapter beside shared Application.

`tone.ogg` is the repository's author-generated 0.12-second, 440 Hz, stereo 48 kHz
Vorbis fixture (libvorbis quality 2), identical to the hexadecimal fixture in
`tests/audio/audio_service_tests.cpp`. It is test data, not third-party music.
The audio service tests additionally request cancellation between actual decode
blocks, check no partial publication, and verify allocation/quota behavior.

The three `reject_mixed_core_*` tests require CMake generation to reject direct,
private static-adapter and interface-adapter combinations of Core and Application.
See `docs/COMPILER_CACHE.md` for the consumer linking and runtime packaging rule.
