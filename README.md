# GUI.Forms

A retained, WinForms-shaped native C++20 toolkit that paints on the CPU and
runs the same control tree on macOS, Windows and Linux.

[![CI](https://github.com/falseywinchnet/gui_forms/actions/workflows/native.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/falseywinchnet/gui_forms/actions/workflows/native.yml) [![Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/gui-forms/badge/?version=latest)](https://gui-forms.readthedocs.io/) [![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/falseywinchnet/gui_forms?display_name=tag)](https://github.com/falseywinchnet/gui_forms/releases) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE) ![C++20](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-20-00599C.svg) ![Platforms](https://img.shields.io/badge/platforms-macOS%20%7C%20Windows%20%7C%20Linux-lightgrey.svg)

**Status: early public preview. The API is not yet stable. The macOS and
Windows hosts are native; the Linux X11 host is opt-in. GUI.Forms is CPU-only
by design and has no GPU backend. Text is drawn by one HarfBuzz/FreeType
engine from bundled fonts, so the same string renders identically on every
platform ([ADR-004](decisions/ADR-004-one-text-rasterization-engine.md)).**

## First window

```cpp
#include <gui_forms/application.hpp>
#include <gui_forms/basic_controls.hpp>
#include <gui_forms/component.hpp>

#include <memory>

namespace gf = gui_forms;

struct Greeter final : gf::Component {
    std::shared_ptr<gf::Panel> root = gf::make_control<gf::Panel>(gf::StableId("root"));
    std::shared_ptr<gf::Label> status = gf::make_control<gf::Label>(gf::StableId("status"), "Ready.");
    std::shared_ptr<gf::Button> run = gf::make_control<gf::Button>(gf::StableId("run"), "Run");
    Greeter() {
        (*status).set_bounds({24.0, 24.0, 432.0, 32.0});
        (*run).set_bounds({24.0, 72.0, 120.0, 36.0});
        (*root).add_child(status);
        (*root).add_child(run);
        gf::on((*run).clicked(), *this, &Greeter::on_run); // owned: revoked with Greeter
    }
    void on_run() { (*status).set_text("Clicked."); }
};

int main() {
    Greeter greeter{};
    std::unique_ptr<gf::Window> window = std::make_unique<gf::Window>(greeter.root, gf::Size{480.0, 140.0});
    return gf::Application::run(std::move(window),
        {.title = "First window", .initial_size = {480.0, 140.0},
         .minimum_size = {320.0, 140.0}}).accepted() ? 0 : 1;
}
```

Controls are created once with a `StableId`, the tree owns them, mutation is
imperative, and painting uses accumulated damage bounds. The longer walkthrough is
in [Your first window](https://gui-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/first-window.html).

![GUI.Forms Gallery on macOS](docs/images/gallery-macos.png)

![GUI.Forms Correspondence on macOS](docs/images/correspondence-macos.png)

Both frames were written by the programs themselves with `--capture`, which
saves the first fully presented frame as a PNG and exits.

## Downloads

Three demonstration programs are built from `demo/` and
`file_manager_demoboard/` using only the public headers.

| Program | What it is |
|---|---|
| GUI.Forms Gallery | Catalogue of the stock controls on 29 pages grouped by function |
| GUI.Forms Explore (preview) | Fixture-backed file-explorer interface from `file_manager_demoboard/`; never touches the real filesystem |
| GUI.Forms Correspondence | Mail-client mockup over in-memory fixtures (`demo/correspondence/`); no real mail, filesystem or network |

Every push to `main` that passes the build, the tests and a launch of each
packaged program is published at
[releases/latest](https://github.com/falseywinchnet/gui_forms/releases/latest):
one archive and one installer per program for macOS arm64, Windows x64, Linux
x64 and Linux arm64, plus `SHA256SUMS.txt`. The `build-<sha>` pre-releases are
compiler-cache archives for CI, not downloads.

- **Linux** builds need an X11 display (XWayland works).
- **macOS** builds are ad hoc signed, not notarized. Right-click the app and
  choose Open on first launch.
- **Windows** builds are unsigned. SmartScreen shows "More info", then
  "Run anyway".

See [Download](https://gui-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/download.html) for the full platform notes.

## Features

- Retained controls with explicit ownership: the tree owns its children,
  handlers are owned by a `Component` and revoked with it.
- Typed layout, paint and hit-test dirtiness, with nested update scopes and
  bounded flushes.
- Damage-limited CPU painting. No redraw loop; nothing repaints until
  something changes.
- Forms-like focus, pointer, keyboard and activation behaviour on every host.
- One text engine (HarfBuzz shaping, FreeType rasterization, bundled fonts):
  identical glyphs on every OS.
- Structured instrumentation counters and snapshots, plus an on-screen
  diagnostics panel in the Gallery.
- Stable IDs on every control, used by logs, semantics, tests and automation.
- A C ABI seam (`include/gui_forms/c_api.h`) and an installed CMake SDK
  (`GUIForms::Application`).
- CNG (native resources) and PNG (interchange) are the only image codecs in
  the core.
- No GPU, no .NET, no browser engine.

## Supported platforms

| Platform | Host | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| macOS 14.0+ | AppKit | Native | Apple silicon (arm64) only; builds `GUI.Forms Gallery.app` |
| Windows 10+ | Win32 DIB | Native | x64; native build in MSYS2 CLANG64 with LLVM 22.1.x |
| Linux | X11 | Opt-in | `-DGUI_FORMS_ENABLE_LINUX_HOST=ON`; Ubuntu 24.04 x64 and arm64 tested in CI; programs packaged as `.deb` and `.tar.gz` |

The portable core (`Core`, `Controls`, `Drawing`, `Threading`) is host
independent; its build still requires LLVM 22.1.x. The `Application` host is
platform specific.

## Build from source

Prerequisites: CMake 3.25+, Ninja, LLVM 22.1 (selected by
[`cmake/llvm22.cmake`](cmake/llvm22.cmake)) and Python 3.12+. Native builds
require an explicit `sh third_party/fetch_text_stack.sh` before configuration.
Follow [Install](https://gui-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install.html) for the platform-specific renderer,
host and dependency preparation. CI reuses tested trees and publishes a
compiler cache per platform; see
[Fast, reproducible builds](https://gui-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building/fast-builds.html).

A renderer-free build for core and control tests needs no Skia or text fetch:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/llvm22.cmake \
    -DGUI_FORMS_ENABLE_SKIA=OFF -DGUI_FORMS_ENABLE_HARFBUZZ_TEXT=OFF \
    -DGUI_FORMS_ENABLE_MACOS_HOST=OFF -DGUI_FORMS_ENABLE_WINDOWS_HOST=OFF \
    -DGUI_FORMS_ENABLE_LINUX_HOST=OFF -DGUI_FORMS_BUILD_GALLERY=OFF
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

After configuring a native build as described in Install, run the Gallery:

- macOS: `open "build/GUI.Forms Gallery.app"`
- Windows: `build/GUI.Forms Gallery.exe` (keep `fonts/` beside it)
- Linux: `build/gui-forms-gallery`; configure with
  `-DGUI_FORMS_ENABLE_LINUX_HOST=ON`

Per-platform toolchain setup and every build option are in
[Build from source](https://gui-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building/index.html).

## Consume the SDK

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.25)
project(MyForms LANGUAGES CXX)
find_package(GUIForms 0.2 CONFIG REQUIRED COMPONENTS Application)
add_executable(app main.cpp)
target_compile_features(app PRIVATE cxx_std_20)
target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE GUIForms::Application)
```

Install with `cmake --install build`, then configure your project with
`-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<prefix>` and the same toolchain file. Never link
`GUIForms::Core` or `GUIForms::Controls` into a program that links
`GUIForms::Application`; CMake rejects the combination. Details and runtime
files to ship: [Consume the SDK](https://gui-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/consume-the-sdk.html).
`examples/reference/` is a complete consumer built against the installed SDK
in CI.

## Documentation

- [gui-forms.readthedocs.io](https://gui-forms.readthedocs.io/): the rendered
  site, built from [`docs/`](docs/).
- [Controls by function](https://gui-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/controls/generated/by-function.html): every stock
  control, its WinForms counterpart and a one-line description.
- [API reference](https://gui-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html): every public type, member and
  enumeration, generated from the headers.
- [`decisions/`](decisions/): architecture decision records.
- [`planning/`](planning/): internal plans and working notes, kept as records
  rather than user documentation.

## Project boundaries

GUI.Forms is a control toolkit. Deliberately excluded: GPU rendering (no Ganesh, Graphite, GL,
Vulkan, Metal, Direct3D or WebGPU), .NET, Java, browser engines, Godot,
immediate-mode control APIs, host font catalogues for control text, and image codecs other than
PNG. AppKit stays in `src/host/macos/`, Win32 in `src/host/windows/`, X11 in
`src/host/linux/` and Skia in `src/render/skia/`; tests enforce these
boundaries.

## Contributing

CI ([`native.yml`](.github/workflows/native.yml)) must pass on every platform.
C++ follows [`planning/PROGRAMMING_HOUSE_STYLE.md`](planning/PROGRAMMING_HOUSE_STYLE.md);
CI fails on any spelling finding from
`python3 -B tools/check_house_style.py include src demo tests examples tools file_manager_demoboard stx_vorbis`,
so run it before you push. Build the docs with `sphinx-build -W docs <out>` so
warnings fail.
Boundary violations fail `ctest` before review.
