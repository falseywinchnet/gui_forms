# Repository tools

The scripts and programs under `tools/` that a contributor runs. Commands run
from the repository root. Each Python script prints its full options with
`--help`.

The shared CI tools and the checkers (`check_house_style.py`,
`check_lifetime_rules.py`, `check_state_machines.py`, `windows_toolchain.py`,
the `ci_*.py` tools and the rest that `tools/harness_link.py` lists) live in
template_harness, checked out beside this repository at the commit
`harness.lock` pins. Their `tools/` paths below are forwarding shims to it:
[GUI.Forms builds through template_harness](../building/template-harness.md).

## Documentation and the control registry

`tools/control_registry.py`
: Loads and validates `manifests/controls.json`. `check` validates the records
  and their header coverage, `render` writes the control indexes under
  `docs/controls/generated/`, `readme-table` prints or splices
  (`--write README.md`) the README control table, and `emit-cpp` writes or,
  with `--check`, verifies `demo/gallery_catalog.inc`.
  `python3 tools/control_registry.py check`

`tools/generate_library_docs.py`
: Generates the API reference pages under `docs/api/` and the documented
  examples test `tests/doc_examples_tests.cpp`. `--check` regenerates into a
  temporary directory and fails if the committed output differs.
  `python3 tools/generate_library_docs.py --check`

`tools/api_reference.py`
: Extracts the exact declaration inventory `docs/reference/inventory.json`
  with `clang -ast-dump=json` and validates the reviewed contracts in
  `docs/reference/contracts/`. Without options it rewrites the inventory;
  `--check` fails on a stale inventory or an invalid contract. The dump
  depends on the compiler build, so run it with LLVM 22.1.8 (`--clang`).
  `python3 tools/api_reference.py --check --clang /path/to/clang++`

## House style

`tools/check_house_style.py`
: The spelling scanner the `house-style` CI job runs (see
  [Style guide](style.md)). Takes files or directories, reports one line per
  finding and exits non-zero on any finding or on an empty scope.
  `python3 -B tools/check_house_style.py src/core/image tests/png_writer_tests.cpp`

`tools/check_lifetime_rules.py`
: The borrow and foreign-type checks the `house-style` job runs (house style
  sections 1 and 2). Heuristics over masked source, like the spelling
  scanner; they do not check destruction order.
  `python3 -B tools/check_lifetime_rules.py tests/semantic_tests.cpp`

`tools/check_state_machines.py`
: The state-machine checker (house style sections 2 and 3). With
  `--build-dir`, it runs the compiler's switch warnings over a configured
  ninja tree. The `state-machine-gate` CI job
  (`.github/workflows/state-machines.yml`) runs it with `--gate`, which
  fails on any F1 or F2. `--changed-from BASE` checks only the translation
  units that the C and C++ changes since BASE can affect, and passes at once
  when there are none. The daily run checks the whole tree.
  `python3 -B tools/check_state_machines.py --root . --build-dir <tree> --gate --changed-from origin/main`

`tools/sanitizer/lsan.supp`
: LeakSanitizer suppressions for the `sanitizers` CI job: system libraries
  only, never a first-party frame.

`tools/house_policy_check/`
: A Clang LibTooling checker for the full C++ subset, run over a build's
  compilation database and writing a JSON ledger; it is not linked into any
  product. Build it into `.build/house-policy-check/` against a current LLVM,
  configure the main build with `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`, then run
  the wrapper. Inventory mode records findings without failing; set
  `GUI_FORMS_HOUSE_POLICY_MODE=closure` to fail on any violation. Optional
  arguments write pointer-arrow and `auto` rewrite plans (applied with
  `apply_pointer_rewrites.py` and `apply_auto_type_rewrites.py`), select a
  `native` or `mingw` database, and widen the scope from `production`
  (`src/`) to `first-party`. The wrapper uses Homebrew LLVM and the Xcode SDK,
  so it runs on macOS.
  `tools/house_policy_check/run_inventory.sh "$PWD/build" ledger.json`

## Build, install and packaging

`tools/ci_build.py`
: Builds and tests the toolkit exactly as the native CI job does: fetches the
  text stack and Skia, configures with `cmake/llvm22.cmake`, runs `ctest`,
  installs into a scratch SDK and builds `examples/reference/` against it.
  It expects the checkout in a directory named `gui_forms` and writes to
  `../.build/native-<host>-<arch>/`. `--gallery` also builds the programs.
  `python3 tools/ci_build.py --jobs 4`

`tools/verify_install.py`
: Builds an independent consumer against an installed SDK prefix and checks
  that requests for missing CMake components fail. `--native` exercises the
  `Application` component, `--relocate` copies the SDK to a new prefix first,
  and `--toolchain` and `--runner` build the consumer with another CMake
  toolchain and run its tests through an emulator. `--feature-components`
  (with `--native`) also builds and runs `tests/installed_feature_consumer/`
  against a `build_sdk.py --features all` prefix, through the `TextMasks` and
  `AudioLoopTransport` components. Without it, those two must be rejected.
  `python3 tools/verify_install.py /path/to/prefix --native`

`tools/package_programs.py`
: Packages the programs listed in `packaging/programs.json` from a build
  directory: an `.app` zip and `pkg` installer on macOS, a zip and NSIS
  installer on Windows, a `tar.gz` and Debian package on Linux, plus
  `SHA256SUMS.txt` and a `packages-<platform>.json` receipt. `--dry-run`
  prints the plan; `--no-installer` writes archives only.
  `python3 tools/package_programs.py --build-dir build --version 0.2.0 --out dist`

`tools/smoke_package.py`
: Extracts each packaged program, launches it with `--smoke-test` and the
  bundled fonts, and requires a clean exit, the pass line and at least one
  presented frame. `--install` also applies the installer and launches the
  installed copy. Results go to `smoke-<platform>.json`.
  `python3 tools/smoke_package.py --dist dist`

`tools/build_macos_runtimes.py`
: Builds the pinned LLVM runtimes (libc++ and its dependencies) with a
  macOS 14 arm64 minimum; the result is the prefix `GUI_FORMS_LLVM_RUNTIME`
  names. `tools/audit_macos_minimum.py PATH...` rejects Mach-O images outside
  that arm64 / macOS 14 contract.
  `python3 tools/build_macos_runtimes.py --work .build/runtimes-work --prefix .build/llvm-runtime`

`tools/prove_compiler_cache.py`
: Builds a clean source snapshot cold through a fresh compiler cache, then a
  relocated copy through the same cache, writes both timings and cache
  statistics to `receipt.json` in the scratch directory and fails if reuse
  changes the binary. Only copies under the scratch directory are edited.
  `python3 tools/prove_compiler_cache.py --source . --scratch .build/cache-proof --jobs 4`

## Windows and Wine

`tools/windows_toolchain.py`
: Packs, fetches and restores the exact MSYS2 CLANG64 tree recorded in
  `tools/windows_toolchain.json`, whose `clang.exe` is the compiler the cache
  manifests record. Requires Python 3.14.
  `python tools/windows_toolchain.py restore`

`gui_forms_windows_probe`
: The automation client built from `tools/windows_automation_probe.cpp` with
  every Windows host build. It sends one command (`snapshot`, `click <id>`,
  `activate <id>`, `capture [path]`, `close`, `list` and others) to a running
  program started with `--automation`.
  `wine gui_forms_windows_probe.exe click gallery.checkbox`

`tools/run_windows_wine_smoke.sh`, `tools/run_windows_gallery_text_smoke.sh`, `tools/run_windows_gallery_services_smoke.sh`
: Run a Windows build of the gallery under Wine through the probe and assert
  on the structured log; see [Windows builds and Wine](../building/index.md#windows-builds-and-wine).
  They need `wine` (`WINE_BINARY`, default `/opt/homebrew/bin/wine`) and
  `rg`. The plain and text smokes accept `GUI_FORMS_EVIDENCE_DIR` to redirect
  their logs and captures.
  `tools/run_windows_wine_smoke.sh build-windows-x64`

## Measurement, data and test machines

`tools/png_admission_probe/`
: A standalone consumer of an installed SDK that times `validate_png` and
  `ImageRegistry::load_png` separately on generated uncompressed PNGs and
  prints six samples without a threshold. `fixture.py` writes the fixtures and
  refuses to overwrite them. Its `README.md` has the full procedure.
  `python3 tools/png_admission_probe/fixture.py .build/png-admission-data`

`tools/unicode/generate_grapheme_tables.py`
: Regenerates the Unicode 17.0.0 grapheme-break tables
  (`src/core/text/unicode/unicode_grapheme_data.hpp`) and conformance cases
  (`tests/unicode_grapheme_break_cases.hpp`) from the downloaded Unicode data
  files, whose hashes it checks.
  `python3 tools/unicode/generate_grapheme_tables.py --grapheme GraphemeBreakProperty.txt --derived DerivedCoreProperties.txt --emoji emoji-data.txt --test GraphemeBreakTest.txt --tables-output src/core/text/unicode/unicode_grapheme_data.hpp --tests-output tests/unicode_grapheme_break_cases.hpp`

`tools/linux_vm/`
: A Lima definition for an Alpine aarch64 (musl) guest with Clang 22, Xvfb
  and Weston, for building and graphically testing the Linux host. It covers
  aarch64 musl only; CI's Ubuntu jobs cover glibc and x86-64.
  `limactl create --name=gui-forms-linux tools/linux_vm/gui-forms-linux.yaml`

Unit tests for the scripts
: `tools/test_*.py` cover the scripts above; the `house-style` job runs each
  file on its own.
  `python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tools -p test_control_registry.py`

## CI plumbing

These run inside the workflows and are rarely run by hand:
`ci_reuse.py` and `ci_promote.py` reuse or promote validation of an identical
tree; `ci_tree_receipt.py` and `release_tests.py` let the docs, Sanitizers
and programs jobs carry an earlier run of the same tree; `compiler_identity.py`, `cache_manifest.py`, `publish_cache.py` and
`prune_cache_releases.py` describe, publish and prune the compiler-cache
pre-releases; `macos_runtime_manifest.py` and `prove_macos_runtime_restore.py`
check the published macOS runtime payload; `publication_version.py` and
`publish_tested_release.py` select a version and publish tested packages.
