GUI.Forms is a retained, CPU-rendered forms toolkit written in C++20. You
build a tree of controls once, change it imperatively, and the toolkit tracks
exactly which layout, paint and hit-test work each change requires. It
provides stock controls in the Windows Forms tradition (buttons, text boxes,
lists, trees, tabs, splitters, menus, layout panels, bindings and timers),
native hosts for macOS, Windows and Linux, one text engine with identical
output on every platform, and an installed CMake SDK.

        Getting started
        ^^^

        New to GUI.Forms? Your first window takes one class and one
        function. It introduces controls, ownership and event handlers, and
        links to the rest of the guide.

        API reference
        ^^^

        The reference describes every stock control and library type: what
        it is for, its constructor, properties, events and methods, with
        examples. It assumes you know the key concepts.
