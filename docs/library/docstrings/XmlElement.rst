One element of an XML document, with its attributes, children and text.

GUI.Forms reads and writes a small, bounded subset of XML for its own files,
such as saved docking layouts. `read_xml` turns a UTF-8 document into a tree
of `XmlElement` values, and `write_xml` turns a tree back into a document.
An element is a plain record: `name`, `attributes` in document order,
`children` in document order, and `text`, the decoded character data of an
element that has no children. Build one with ordinary assignments and
`push_back`.

Methods
-------
find_attribute
    The attribute with the given name, or null. The pointer borrows from the
    element and is invalidated by any change to its attributes.

See Also
--------
XmlLimits : The bounds a read or a write enforces.
XmlReadResult : What `read_xml` returns: the root, or an error and where it was found.
XmlWriteResult : What `write_xml` returns: the document text, or an error.

Notes
-----
The subset is UTF-8 only. It has elements, attributes, character data, the
five predefined entities (``&amp;``, ``&lt;``, ``&gt;``, ``&apos;``,
``&quot;``) and numeric character references. Comments are read and dropped.
A DTD, a processing instruction other than the leading
``<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`` declaration, and a CDATA section
are refused with their own errors, so no external entity can ever be
fetched. There is no namespace processing: a colon is an ordinary name
character and ``xmlns`` attributes are ordinary attributes.

An element holds either child elements or text, never both. When it has
children, whitespace between them is indentation and is not kept; any other
text beside a child is refused as `XmlError::mixed_content`. An element
without children keeps its text exactly, including surrounding whitespace.

The reader applies XML's line-end and attribute-value normalization: CR LF
and CR become LF in text, and a literal tab, CR or LF in an attribute value
becomes a space. The writer escapes those characters as references where
they would otherwise change, so writing what `read_xml` returned for a
written document reproduces it byte for byte.

Malformed input never throws. Every error is an `XmlError` with the line,
the column (in characters) and the byte offset where it was found, and a
failed read returns an empty root.

Examples
--------
Read a document, inspect it and write it back:

.. code-block:: cpp

   gf::XmlReadResult read = gf::read_xml(
       "<layout format=\"2\"><panel id=\"tools.output\"/></layout>");
   if (!read) {
       return;   // read.error, read.position.line and read.position.column say why
   }
   const gf::XmlAttribute* format = read.root.find_attribute("format");   // "2"
   std::size_t panels = read.root.children.size();                       // 1
   gf::XmlWriteResult written = gf::write_xml(read.root);
   // written.text:
   // <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   // <layout format="2">
   //   <panel id="tools.output"/>
   // </layout>
   static_cast<void>(format);
   static_cast<void>(panels);

Build a tree and see a refusal:

.. code-block:: cpp

   gf::XmlElement root;
   root.name = "settings";
   root.attributes.push_back(gf::XmlAttribute{.name = "theme", .value = "a & b"});
   gf::XmlElement note;
   note.name = "note";
   note.text = "x < y";
   root.children.push_back(note);
   gf::XmlWriteResult written = gf::write_xml(root);   // escapes & and <

   gf::XmlElement mixed = root;
   mixed.text = "text beside a child";
   gf::XmlWriteResult refused = gf::write_xml(mixed);
   bool is_mixed = refused.error == gf::XmlError::mixed_content;   // true
   static_cast<void>(written);
   static_cast<void>(is_mixed);
