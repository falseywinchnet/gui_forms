A diagnostic panel that shows the window's runtime counters.

A metrics view draws a dark card with a title and one or two lines read from
the window's `MetricsSnapshot`: the number of controls, paint passes, reused
display chunks, input events, active surfaces and focus scopes, and the area
painted. It is meant for development builds, test windows and diagnostics
panels, where it shows whether an interaction repaints more than it should or
leaves the window busy. It ignores the pointer. Read `Window::metrics_snapshot`
directly when the numbers are needed in code.

Parameters
----------
stable_id
    Identity of the control, unique within its window.
title
    Heading drawn on the card, "Runtime metrics" by default. It is also the
    accessible name.

Properties
----------
title
    Heading drawn on the card and published as the accessible name.
style
    The `BasicControlStyle` colours: the card is filled with `text`, the
    accent bar uses `accent`, the title `face_light` and the counters `face`.
accent_width : default ``5.0``
    Width of the accent bar at the left edge, in layout units. It must be
    finite and from 1 to 32, or `std::invalid_argument` is thrown.

See Also
--------
VisualInspectorView : Shows the layout and paint state of one control.
EasingPreview : Compares easing curves under the current motion policy.

Notes
-----
The view reads the counters when it paints and when its semantics are
queried, but it does not repaint by itself when they change. Refresh it
explicitly with `invalidate`, for example from a `Timer`, as the second
example does.

The view publishes the accessibility role `group`, named by `title`, with the
counters as its value. While it is not attached to a window, it shows
`Detached`.

Examples
--------
Add a metrics card to a window and read what it shows:

.. code-block:: cpp

   std::shared_ptr<gf::Panel> root = gf::make_control<gf::Panel>(gf::StableId("app"));
   std::shared_ptr<gf::MetricsView> metrics =
       gf::make_control<gf::MetricsView>(gf::StableId("app.metrics"), "Window counters");
   (*metrics).set_requested_bounds({0.0, 0.0, 360.0, 84.0});
   (*root).add_child(metrics);
   gf::Window window(root, gf::Size{360.0, 84.0});
   window.perform_layout();
   gf::SemanticDescriptor semantics = (*metrics).semantic_descriptor();
   // semantics.value lists the counters, starting with the number of controls

Refresh the card once a second with an owned timer:

.. code-block:: cpp

   struct MetricsRefresh final : gf::Component {
       std::shared_ptr<gf::MetricsView> view;
       gf::Timer timer;

       MetricsRefresh(gf::Window& window, std::shared_ptr<gf::MetricsView> target)
           : view(std::move(target)), timer(window, std::chrono::seconds(1)) {
           gf::on(timer.tick(), *this, &MetricsRefresh::on_tick);
           timer.start();
       }
       void on_tick() { (*view).invalidate(gf::Dirty::paint | gf::Dirty::semantics); }
   };

   void example() {
       std::shared_ptr<gf::MetricsView> metrics =
           gf::make_control<gf::MetricsView>(gf::StableId("app.metrics"));
       gf::Window window(metrics, gf::Size{360.0, 84.0});
       MetricsRefresh refresh(window, metrics);
   }
