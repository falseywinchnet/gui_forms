The host's dialog for choosing where to save a file.

A save file dialog asks the user for a path to save to, as Windows Forms'
SaveFileDialog does. It holds its settings (a title, a starting directory, a
filter, a default extension and whether to ask before replacing a file)
and, after the user accepts, the chosen path. `show_dialog` shows it
modally over a window and returns when it closes. The host draws the
dialog: `GetSaveFileNameW` on Windows, `NSSavePanel` on macOS, and a dialog
of GUI.Forms controls on X11.

The dialog is shown through the window's `HostServices` (capability
``dialogs``). A window without a host, or a host without the capability,
does not show it: `show_dialog` returns ``none`` and `status` says why.

Properties
----------
title : default empty
    The dialog's title; empty gives the host's own. `set_title` throws
    `std::invalid_argument` for text that is not valid UTF-8, holds NUL or
    is longer than `HostServices::maximum_dialog_text_bytes`, and keeps the
    old title.
initial_directory : default empty
    The directory the dialog starts in; empty lets the host choose. Refused
    as `title` is.
filter : default empty
    The filter in Windows Forms' syntax, as `OpenFileDialog` reads it:
    ``"Reports|*.txt|All files|*.*"``. `set_filter` throws
    `std::invalid_argument` for a string `parse_file_dialog_filter` refuses,
    and keeps the old filter. The first filter is the one the dialog starts
    with.
filters
    The host filters the filter parsed into, in order.
default_ext : default empty
    The extension a chosen name without one is given, without its dot; a
    leading dot is removed when it is set. An extension holding a wildcard,
    a path separator or a character Windows forbids in a name is refused.
add_extension : default ``true``
    Whether a chosen name without an extension is given `default_ext`. A
    name has an extension when it holds a dot that is not its last
    character, as .NET's ``Path.HasExtension`` says.
overwrite_prompt : default ``true``
    Whether the host asks before the user chooses a file that exists.
file_name
    The chosen path, or empty. Before the dialog is shown, a name set with
    `set_file_name` is the one the dialog suggests.
file_names
    The chosen path as a list of one, or none.
status
    The host's answer to the last `show_dialog`.

Events
------
file_ok
    Raised when the user accepts, before the dialog takes the path. The
    payload's ``file_names`` holds the path, with `default_ext` already
    added. Setting ``cancel`` keeps the old path and shows the dialog again
    with the same settings, where Windows Forms keeps its dialog open.

Methods
-------
show_dialog
    Shows the dialog over `owner` and returns when it closes: ``ok`` when the
    user accepted and no `file_ok` handler cancelled, ``cancel`` when the
    user cancelled, ``none`` when the dialog could not be shown. Throws
    `std::logic_error` for a disposed dialog, for one already showing, and
    off the window's UI thread.
reset
    Restores every setting to its default and forgets the chosen path.

Notes
-----
The hosts add the default extension themselves (Windows and X11 to a typed
name without one, macOS as the type it allows when the filter names none),
so it is sent to the host only while `add_extension` is on; the dialog adds
it to a path the host returned without one. A path the addition would make
longer than the dialog contract allows is kept as chosen. Windows Forms
first tries the extension of the selected filter; GUI.Forms does not yet
know which filter the user selected, so it uses `default_ext` alone.

A `file_ok` handler may dispose or destroy the dialog; `show_dialog` then
returns ``cancel`` without touching it. A handler that cancels and destroys
the owner window also ends the call with ``cancel``. Each request has its
own identity, unique in the process and shared with the other dialog
components.

Not yet supported: the filter index (the host request has no field for it),
the prompt to create a file that does not exist, checking that the chosen
directory exists (each host's save dialog chooses only existing
directories), and opening the chosen file; GUI.Forms writes no files for
the program.

Examples
--------
A dialog for exporting a report, shown over a window:

.. code-block:: cpp

   std::shared_ptr<gf::Panel> root = gf::make_control<gf::Panel>(gf::StableId("doc.root"));
   gf::Window window(root, {320.0, 200.0});
   gf::SaveFileDialog dialog;
   dialog.set_title("Export report");
   dialog.set_filter("Reports|*.txt|All files|*.*");
   dialog.set_default_ext("txt");
   dialog.set_file_name("summary");
   const gf::DialogResult result = dialog.show_dialog(window);
   if (result == gf::DialogResult::ok) {
       const std::string& path = dialog.file_name();
       static_cast<void>(path);
   } else if (result == gf::DialogResult::none) {
       // Without a host, dialog.status().error is gf::HostServiceError::unsupported.
   }
