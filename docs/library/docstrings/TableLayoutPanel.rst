A container that arranges its children in a grid of sized rows and columns.

A table layout panel divides its client area into column and row tracks.
Each track is sized absolutely, to fit its content, or as a weighted share of
the space left over, and each child occupies one cell or a span of cells.
Children without an explicit cell fill the free cells row by row, and the
table grows by rows or columns when it runs out. Use it for forms, property
sheets and any layout whose items must line up. Use a `FlowLayoutPanel`
instead when items simply follow one another, and a `ResponsiveTrackPanel`
when regions must collapse in a set order as the window narrows.

Parameters
----------
stable_id
    Identity of the panel, unique within its window.

Properties
----------
column_count : default ``1``
    The number of authored column tracks, from 1 through 64. Out-of-range
    values throw `std::out_of_range`. Growing the count adds columns with the
    default `TableSizeMode::auto_size` style; shrinking it drops the styles
    of the removed columns.
row_count : default ``1``
    The number of authored row tracks, from 1 through 64, with the same rules
    as `column_count`.
grow_style : default ``TableLayoutGrowStyle::add_rows``
    What happens when a child does not fit the authored grid.
    `TableLayoutGrowStyle::add_rows` and `TableLayoutGrowStyle::add_columns`
    add tracks for the current layout, up to 64 per axis;
    `TableLayoutGrowStyle::fixed_size` leaves the child out. The added
    tracks use the `auto_size` style and do not change `column_count` or
    `row_count`.
cell_border_style : default ``TableCellBorderStyle::none``
    Lines drawn around and between the cells: none, a single line, or a
    two-tone inset or outset line. Grid lines sit in the middle of the
    `track_spacing` gaps. Changing it does not affect layout.
track_spacing : default ``{0.0, 0.0}``
    Space left between neighbouring columns (`width`) and rows (`height`),
    but not outside the outer tracks. Each value must be finite and between
    0 and 256.
column_styles
    The size mode and size of each authored column, one per column. Set them
    with `set_column_style`.
row_styles
    The size mode and size of each authored row. Set them with
    `set_row_style`.
column_widths
    The column widths resolved by the last layout, including any columns the
    table added. Empty before the first layout.
row_heights
    The row heights resolved by the last layout, including any rows the table
    added. Empty before the first layout.
layout_overflowed : default ``false``
    Whether the last layout left a visible child out because it found no cell
    for it.

Methods
-------
set_column_style
    `set_column_style(column, style)` sets how one column is sized.
    `TableSizeMode::absolute` makes it exactly `style.size` wide, whatever its
    content. `TableSizeMode::auto_size` makes it as wide as its widest child
    plus margins, and a child that spans several columns can widen the auto-
    sized columns it covers; `style.size` is ignored. `TableSizeMode::percent`
    gives it a share of the width left after the absolute and auto-sized
    columns and the spacing, in proportion to `style.size` among all percent
    columns, so sizes of 1 and 2 split that width one third to two thirds; its
    content does not widen it. The size must be finite and nonnegative, and
    positive for `percent`, or `std::invalid_argument` is thrown; a column
    index at or beyond `column_count` throws `std::out_of_range`.
set_row_style
    The same as `set_column_style`, for one row.
set_cell_position
    Places `child` at an explicit column and row, counted from 0. A column or
    row of 64 or more throws `std::out_of_range`, and a control that is not a
    live direct child throws `std::invalid_argument`.
clear_cell_position
    Returns `child` to automatic placement.
cell_position
    The cell the last layout placed `child` in. When the last layout placed
    it nowhere, returns the position set with `set_cell_position`, or no
    value if there is none. Reading it brings the layout up to date first.
set_column_span
    The number of columns `child` covers, from 1 through 64, starting at its
    cell. Out-of-range spans throw `std::out_of_range`, and a control that is
    not a live direct child throws `std::invalid_argument`.
column_span
    The column span of `child`; 1 when none is set.
set_row_span
    The number of rows `child` covers, from 1 through 64, with the same
    rules as `set_column_span`.
row_span
    The row span of `child`; 1 when none is set.
control_from_position
    The visible child whose cell or span covers the given column and row, or
    null. Reading it brings the layout up to date first.

Notes
-----
Each layout places children in two passes. First, children with an explicit
cell take it, in child order; a child whose cells are already taken, or lie
outside a grid that `grow_style` cannot extend, is left out. Then the other
children fill the first free cell, or run of cells for a span, scanning row
by row; when none is free, the table adds a row or a column as `grow_style`
allows. A child that is left out gets an empty slot at the top-left corner
and `layout_overflowed` becomes true. Hidden children take no cell, and the
added tracks disappear again when they are no longer needed.

Inside its cell, after its margins, a child keeps its preferred size, but
never more than the cell. `DockStyle::fill` fills the cell; `top`, `bottom`,
`left` and `right` stretch it along that edge. With `DockStyle::none`,
Anchor decides: anchoring both opposite edges stretches the child, one edge
aligns it to that edge, and neither centers it. The default anchor, top and
left, puts the child in the cell's top-left corner.

With `auto_size` on, the panel measures to the size its tracks need,
limited by the space available. Otherwise it takes its requested size, or
all available space when a requested dimension is zero. The panel does not
scroll its cells.

A parent assigns each child a layout slot; the child's own
`requested_bounds` are never rewritten. Setters do nothing when the value is
unchanged, and an invalid value changes nothing.

The panel is not focusable. It publishes the accessibility role `group` only
when it has an accessible name or description.

Examples
--------
A two-column form: labels in a column that fits them, fields in a column that
takes the rest of the width:

.. code-block:: cpp

   std::shared_ptr<gf::TableLayoutPanel> form =
       gf::make_control<gf::TableLayoutPanel>(gf::StableId("form"));
   (*form).set_column_count(2U);
   (*form).set_row_count(2U);
   (*form).set_column_style(0U, {gf::TableSizeMode::auto_size, 0.0});
   (*form).set_column_style(1U, {gf::TableSizeMode::percent, 1.0});
   (*form).set_track_spacing({8.0, 4.0});

   std::shared_ptr<gf::Label> name_label =
       gf::make_control<gf::Label>(gf::StableId("form.name.label"), "Name:");
   std::shared_ptr<gf::TextBox> name =
       gf::make_control<gf::TextBox>(gf::StableId("form.name"));
   std::shared_ptr<gf::Label> email_label =
       gf::make_control<gf::Label>(gf::StableId("form.email.label"), "Email:");
   std::shared_ptr<gf::TextBox> email =
       gf::make_control<gf::TextBox>(gf::StableId("form.email"));
   (*name).set_anchor(gf::AnchorStyles::left | gf::AnchorStyles::right);
   (*email).set_anchor(gf::AnchorStyles::left | gf::AnchorStyles::right);

   // Automatic placement fills the cells row by row.
   (*form).add_child(name_label);
   (*form).add_child(name);
   (*form).add_child(email_label);
   (*form).add_child(email);

   gf::Window window(form, {320.0, 80.0});
   window.perform_layout();
   // Each field stretches across the second column, less its margins;
   // the column's width is (*form).column_widths()[1].

A heading that spans both columns, with automatic children below it. In a
fixed-size table, a child with no free cell is left out:

.. code-block:: cpp

   std::shared_ptr<gf::TableLayoutPanel> grid =
       gf::make_control<gf::TableLayoutPanel>(gf::StableId("grid"));
   (*grid).set_column_count(2U);
   (*grid).set_row_count(2U);
   (*grid).set_grow_style(gf::TableLayoutGrowStyle::fixed_size);

   std::shared_ptr<gf::Label> heading =
       gf::make_control<gf::Label>(gf::StableId("grid.heading"), "Totals");
   std::shared_ptr<gf::Button> left =
       gf::make_control<gf::Button>(gf::StableId("grid.left"), "Left");
   std::shared_ptr<gf::Button> right =
       gf::make_control<gf::Button>(gf::StableId("grid.right"), "Right");
   std::shared_ptr<gf::Button> extra =
       gf::make_control<gf::Button>(gf::StableId("grid.extra"), "Extra");
   (*grid).add_child(heading);
   (*grid).add_child(left);
   (*grid).add_child(right);
   (*grid).add_child(extra);
   (*grid).set_cell_position(*heading, {0U, 0U});
   (*grid).set_column_span(*heading, 2U);

   gf::Window window(grid, {200.0, 80.0});
   window.perform_layout();
   gf::Control::Ptr top_right = (*grid).control_from_position(1U, 0U);
   // top_right is heading; left and right fill row 1, and
   // (*grid).layout_overflowed() is true because extra found no cell.
