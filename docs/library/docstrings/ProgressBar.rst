A bar that shows how far an operation has progressed.

The bar fills in proportion to its `value` between `minimum` and `maximum`,
which it inherits from `RangeControl` (0 to 100 by default). Update it with
`set_value` or `increment`, or bind it to a `Value<double>` with `bind`. When
the amount of work is unknown, choose `ProgressBarVisualStyle::marquee`, which
sweeps a band across the bar again and again regardless of the value. The bar
is display only: it takes no focus, keyboard or pointer input. Use a
`TrackBar` for a value the user adjusts.

Parameters
----------
stable_id
    Identity of the control, unique within its window. Logs, automation and
    semantic actions address the control by this ID.

Properties
----------
visual_style : default ``ProgressBarVisualStyle::continuous``
    How the bar is drawn: `blocks` (separate segments), `continuous`,
    `marquee` (a moving band for unknown progress), `pulse` (a moving
    highlight over the fill), `marching_stripes` or `laser_etch`. All but
    `blocks` and `continuous` are animated.
overlay_style : default ``ProgressBarOverlayStyle::none``
    `moving_stripes` adds animated diagonal stripes over the fill of any
    style except `marching_stripes`.
stripe_width : default ``7.0``
    Width of the stripes, between 2 and 32; other values throw
    `std::invalid_argument`.
animation_appearance : default ``ProgressBarAnimationAppearance{}``
    Colours and extents of the pulse, stripe and laser effects. Out-of-range
    extents throw `std::invalid_argument`.
animation_enabled : default ``true``
    Whether animated styles move. When false they are drawn still and the
    bar schedules no frames.
animation_paused : default ``false``
    Pauses the animation and keeps its current phase, so it resumes where it
    stopped.
reduced_motion : default ``false``
    Requests gentler animation: at most ten frames a second, about a third
    of the speed and half the travel. The bar also reduces motion when the
    window's presentation settings ask for it.
motion_policy : default ``MotionPolicy{}``
    The whole policy: `enabled`, `paused` and `reduced`. A policy that is not
    enabled stops the animation like a pause. `set_motion_policy` also
    accepts paused and reduced as two booleans.
effective_motion_policy
    `motion_policy` combined with the window's reduced-motion setting; this
    is what the bar animates with.
animation_period : default ``std::chrono::milliseconds(1400)``
    Time for one animation cycle. Periods under 100 ms throw
    `std::invalid_argument`.
animation_phase
    Position in the current animation cycle, from 0 up to 1.

See Also
--------
RangeControl : Minimum, maximum, value and `bind`, shared with `TrackBar`.
TrackBar : A slider the user drags to choose a value.
Value : Application state that a progress bar can follow.

Notes
-----
`set_value` throws `std::out_of_range` for a value outside the range, while
`increment` clamps to it. Changing the range clamps the value and raises
`range_changed` and then, if the value moved, `value_changed`. The inherited
`scroll` event is never raised, because the user cannot move the bar.

A vertical bar, set with `set_orientation`, fills from the bottom. Without a
requested size the bar prefers 160 by 20 horizontally and 20 by 160
vertically.

An animated style registers with the window for about 60 frames a second,
only while it is in a window, visible, enabled for animation and not paused;
a static style schedules nothing. The bar paints from the theme's progress
colours; the inherited `RangeControl` `style` does not change its look.

The control publishes the accessibility role `progress_bar`, with the value
as text and as a number together with the minimum and maximum. It reports busy
while it is animating. Give it a name with `set_accessible_name` that says
what is in progress.

Examples
--------
Follow application state. The bar takes the value's state when the binding
starts, and then tracks every change:

.. code-block:: cpp

   gf::Value<double> copied(0.0);
   std::shared_ptr<gf::ProgressBar> bar =
       gf::make_control<gf::ProgressBar>(gf::StableId("copy.progress"));
   (*bar).set_accessible_name("Copying files");
   (*bar).set_range(0.0, 250.0);   // 250 files
   (*bar).bind(copied);
   copied.set(125.0);              // the bar is now half full

Show activity of unknown length, and pause it while the work waits:

.. code-block:: cpp

   std::shared_ptr<gf::ProgressBar> busy =
       gf::make_control<gf::ProgressBar>(gf::StableId("sync.busy"));
   (*busy).set_accessible_name("Synchronizing");
   (*busy).set_visual_style(gf::ProgressBarVisualStyle::marquee);
   gf::Window window(busy, gf::Size{160.0, 20.0});   // the band now animates
   (*busy).set_animation_paused(true);               // it stops, keeping its phase
