A docking workspace: the layout, the panels and their factories, and which panel and document are active.

A workspace owns a `DockLayout` and, for every panel the program registers,
its title and a factory that builds its content the first time the panel is
shown. It keeps two activation tracks: the active panel (the panel that has,
or last had, keyboard focus, tool or document) and the active document (the
document last active), each with a most-recently-active history. A
`DockSite` shows the main site in a window; once `attach_windows` binds the
main window, the workspace opens one owned floating window per floating
site. Use it for an application with tool panels around a document area.

Parameters
----------
stable_id
    The workspace's identity, used in diagnostics.

Properties
----------
layout
    The layout. Restrictions, dock groups, the workspace lock, saving and
    restoring go through it directly; register panels through
    `register_panel` so that their titles and factories are known.
created_panel_count
    The number of factory runs that produced content.
active_panel : default none
    The active panel.
active_document : default none
    The active document. Activating a tool panel leaves it unchanged.
tool_history
    The placed tool panels that have been active, most recent first.
document_history
    The placed documents that have been active, most recent first.
site : default none
    The `DockSite` showing the main site, or none.
windows_attached : default ``false``
    Whether a main window is attached, so floating sites have windows.
main_window : default inactive
    The attached main window's handle.
floating_window_count : default ``0``
    The live floating windows.
tree_generation : default ``0``
    The generation of the last layout change that touched a site's tree; a
    change that only moved floating windows does not count.
flyout_opening : default ``DockFlyoutOpening::hover_or_click``
    What opens an auto-hidden panel's flyout from its side tab (owner
    decision DK-27, E1-1): resting the pointer on the tab or clicking it, or
    (``click``) only clicking it.

Events
------
activation_changed
    Raised after a track changed, with the track, the old and new panel and
    the cause; when one activation changes both, the panel track is raised
    first.

Methods
-------
register_panel
    Registers a panel's descriptor with the layout and keeps its title and
    factory; registering places nothing. False, changing nothing, for an
    empty or repeated identity.
find_registration
    The registration of a panel, or null.
set_panel_title
    Retitles a panel's caption, tab and navigator row; false for an
    unregistered panel.
panel_title
    The registered title, or the identity when there is none.
apply
    Applies a transaction to the layout, as `DockLayout::apply` does.
show_panel
    Shows a hidden or new panel where it was last and activates it; a
    placed panel is only activated.
hide_panel
    Hides a panel, keeping its placeholder and its content.
close_panel
    Closes a panel and releases its content. A closed tool panel keeps its
    placeholder and reopens where it was; a closed document leaves.
panel_content
    The panel's content, or null before its factory ran.
create_panel_content
    Runs the panel's factory if it has no content yet and returns the
    content.
activate_panel
    Makes a placed panel active: selects it in its stack, creates its
    content, moves focus into it through the site showing it (main or
    floating) and updates the tracks. A panel behind a side tab
    (auto-hidden, or in a stack collapsed by shrinking) opens in its flyout
    with focus inside; an auto-hidden stack's selection is not edited.
    False, changing nothing, for a panel not placed, or floating in a site
    no `DockSite` shows.
attach_windows
    Binds the run's main window (its handle and its
    `ApplicationWindow::stable_id`) and opens a floating window for every
    floating site. The main `DockSite` must be attached to that window.
    False for an inactive handle, an empty identity, a host without runtime
    windows, or windows already attached.
detach_windows
    Destroys the floating windows (their sites stay in the layout) and
    unbinds the main window.
floating_window
    The window showing a floating site, or an inactive handle.
floating_site
    The `DockSite` showing a floating site, or null.
can_float
    Whether a subject may float now: windows attached, room for another
    window, and the layout accepts it (the restrictions, the lock and the
    limit of 32 floating sites).
float_subject
    Floats a subject into a new floating window with the given client area
    in desktop units, recording the monitor it is on.
dock_back_edit
    The edit that docks a subject back: into the stack its panel was docked
    in last, else beside the neighbour remembered there, else a document
    into the document area or a tool panel along its default edge; the
    first the layout accepts. None when no edit is accepted.
dock_back
    Applies `dock_back_edit` and activates the panel.

Notes
-----
Lazy creation (owner decision DK-34): a factory runs the first time its
panel is shown selected in a stack the site shows or in a flyout. A panel
behind another tab, hidden, behind a side tab whose flyout has not opened,
or in a stack hidden by the maximized document area is not created. Hiding
keeps the content; closing releases it,
and a closed panel shown again is built again by its factory.

Command routing (owner decision DK-29): the workspace names, on every
site's window, the command target that the active panel's content control
carries (`Control::set_command_target`) for the active-panel stage, and the
active document's for the active-document stage; floating windows also take
the main window's main-window target. A document command such as Save bound
as a shortcut therefore reaches the active document while focus is in a
tool panel, floating or not: keys a floating window does not use go to the
main window's accelerators (`Window::offer_accelerators`).

Floating windows (phase D4; decisions DK-1, DK-6 to DK-12, DK-44): each
layout change is carried out as one `WorkspaceTransaction` across the
windows. The sites realize it with every window's layout held; a new
floating site gets a window opened hidden, owned by the main window, whose
root is a `DockSite` for the site and which shares the main window's
resources and key bindings; at the commit every window lays out once, the
new windows appear, and only then are the windows of sites that left
destroyed, so a panel moving between windows is never invisible. A window
holding a document is a floating document window, which stays visible while
the application is inactive; any other is a floating tool window, which
hides then. Its client area is the site's frame, placed on a monitor
(`place_on_monitor`), wholly inside the work area when the fallback moved
it and it fits. A move or resize is written back as ``set_floating_frame``
with the monitor it is on (a change that realizes nothing); a frame the
program sets moves the window. The close button hides the window's tool
panels and closes its documents, which closes it.

After every layout change the workspace drops panels that left the layout
from its histories, releases the content of a document that left, and
replaces an active document that left with the next one in its history
(cause ``fallback``) and an active panel that left with the active
document. The sites realize the change after that, the main site first. A
factory is a named delegate; its object must outlive the workspace.

Examples
--------
Two documents and a tool panel whose controls are made only when shown:

.. code-block:: cpp

   struct Views final {
       int made = 0;
       void make(gf::DockPanelCreation& creation) {
           ++made;
           creation.content = gf::make_control<gf::TextBox>(gf::StableId("view." + creation.panel.value));
       }
   };

   void example() {
       Views views;
       gf::DockWorkspace workspace("editor");
       const gf::Delegate<gf::DockPanelCreation&> factory =
           gf::Delegate<gf::DockPanelCreation&>::bind<Views, &Views::make>(views);
       gf::DockPanelRegistration outline{};
       outline.descriptor.id = gf::DockPanelId("outline");
       outline.descriptor.default_placement.side = gf::DockSide::left;
       outline.title = "Outline";
       outline.factory = factory;
       static_cast<void>(workspace.register_panel(outline));
       const std::array<std::string_view, 2> files{"a.txt", "b.txt"};
       for (const std::string_view file : files) {
           gf::DockPanelRegistration document{};
           document.descriptor.id = gf::DockPanelId(std::string(file));
           document.descriptor.kind = gf::DockPanelKind::document;
           document.title = std::string(file);
           document.factory = factory;
           static_cast<void>(workspace.register_panel(document));
           static_cast<void>(workspace.show_panel(document.descriptor.id));
       }
       static_cast<void>(workspace.show_panel(gf::DockPanelId("outline")));
       // views.made is 0: nothing is shown until a site lays the workspace out.
       // The active panel is the outline and the active document b.txt.
   }
