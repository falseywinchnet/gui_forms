A weak handle for asking the host to show, hide, retitle or close a running window.

The `ready` callback in `ApplicationWindowOptions` hands you a handle for its
window; keep a copy wherever you need to act on the native window later, for
example to close it from a Quit button. A handle does not keep the window
alive. Each request returns a `HostServiceStatus` instead of throwing, so a
request that cannot be carried out is reported rather than lost. A
default-constructed handle refers to no window.

Properties
----------
active
    Whether the window is ready and not yet closed, as seen from the calling
    thread. It is false on any other thread than the one that called
    `Application::run`.

Methods
-------
request_close
    Asks the host to close the window, as if the user had clicked its close
    button. The `closing` callback still runs and may cancel the close.
show
    Asks the host to show the window, for example after `hide` or when it
    started hidden.
hide
    Asks the host to hide the window without closing it. The primary window
    cannot be hidden; for it the request returns
    `HostServiceError::invalid_argument`.
toggle_full_screen
    Asks the host to enter or leave full-screen presentation. A host without
    full-screen support returns `HostServiceError::unsupported`.
set_title
    Changes the native title bar text. The empty string is allowed; text over
    65536 bytes, malformed UTF-8 or an embedded NUL returns
    `HostServiceError::invalid_argument` and is not sent to the host. The
    text is only borrowed for the call.

See Also
--------
ApplicationWindowOptions : Delivers the handle through its `ready` callback.
Application : Runs the windows the handles refer to.
HostServiceStatus : The result of each request.

Notes
-----
Every request checks, in this order: a window that is gone, or a
default-constructed handle, returns `HostServiceError::after_shutdown`; a
call from another thread than the one running `Application::run` returns
`HostServiceError::wrong_thread`; a closed window returns
`HostServiceError::after_shutdown`; a window whose `ready` callback has not
run yet returns `HostServiceError::backend_failure`; a service the host does
not provide returns `HostServiceError::unsupported`. An exception inside the
native adapter is reported as `HostServiceError::backend_failure`.

An accepted request means the host received it. The native window may carry
it out later in the same event loop, so do not expect the window to be
hidden or closed when the call returns.

Handles are cheap to copy. After the window closes, or after
`Application::run` returns, every request returns
`HostServiceError::after_shutdown`.

Examples
--------
Keep the handle from `ready` and close the window from a button. This needs a
native host, so it is compiled but not run:

.. code-block:: cpp

   // compile only
   struct Editor final : gf::Component {
       std::shared_ptr<gf::Panel> root = gf::make_control<gf::Panel>(gf::StableId("editor"));
       std::shared_ptr<gf::Button> quit =
           gf::make_control<gf::Button>(gf::StableId("editor.quit"), "&Quit");
       gf::ApplicationWindowHandle handle;

       Editor() {
           (*quit).set_bounds({16.0, 16.0, 96.0, 28.0});
           (*root).add_child(quit);
           gf::on((*quit).clicked(), *this, &Editor::on_quit);
       }
       void on_quit() {
           static_cast<void>(handle.request_close());   // closing may still cancel
       }
   };

   struct KeepHandle final {
       Editor* editor;
       void operator()(gf::Window&, gf::ApplicationWindowHandle window_handle) const {
           (*editor).handle = window_handle;
       }
   };

   void example() {
       Editor editor;
       gf::ApplicationWindowOptions options;
       options.title = "Editor";
       options.ready = KeepHandle{&editor};
       gf::ApplicationResult result = gf::Application::run(
           std::make_unique<gf::Window>(editor.root, gf::Size{640.0, 480.0}), std::move(options));
       static_cast<void>(result);
   }
