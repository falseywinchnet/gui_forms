A grid of typed columns over rows the grid owns, virtual rows or a binding source.

A data grid view shows rows of cells under a row of column headers, with an
optional column of row headers at the left. Each `DataGridViewColumn` is a
text, check box, combo box or button column with a name, header text, width,
read-only flag and alignment. The rows come from one of three sources: unbound
rows the grid owns (`DataGridViewRow` records with stable IDs and
`BindingValue` cells), virtual rows whose order the application publishes as
stable row IDs and whose values an application `DataGridViewCellValueProvider`
supplies by ID as they are shown, or the records of a `BindingSource`. Every
row has a stable ID (`DataGridViewRowId`), and the grid keeps its selection,
current cell and edit by ID; a row number in the API is a presentation
position (`DataGridViewRowPosition`), which inserting, removing and sorting
rows change. Use it for tabular data the user reads, selects and edits in
place; use an `ObjectView` for a list of objects with icons.

Parameters
----------
stable_id
    Identity of the grid, unique within its window. The editor is created as
    ``<stable_id>.editor``, the scroll bars as ``<stable_id>.vertical_scroll``
    and ``<stable_id>.horizontal_scroll``, and combo box choices are shown by
    a `ContextMenu` named ``<stable_id>.choices``.

Properties
----------
columns
    The columns, in display order. `set_columns` replaces them, `add_column`
    appends one and `remove_column_at` removes one. A column name must be
    unique, not empty and without ``.``; its width finite and at least its
    `minimum_width`; and only a combo box column may have `items`. Anything
    else throws `std::invalid_argument`. Replacing or removing columns ends
    any edit and clears the selection and current cell.
row_source : default unbound
    Where the rows come from: `DataGridViewRowSource::unbound`,
    `virtual_rows` or `binding_source`.
row_count
    The number of rows. `set_row_count` grows unbound rows with generated
    rows or cuts them from the end; virtual rows are counted by their order
    and bound rows by their source, so both refuse it with
    `std::logic_error`.
data_source
    The `BindingSource` whose records are the rows, or none.
    `set_data_source` shows a source's records as rows, or returns to empty
    unbound rows for none.
column_headers_visible : default ``true``
    Whether the column header row shows.
row_headers_visible : default ``true``
    Whether the row header column shows.
column_headers_height : default ``23``
    The height of the column header row, from 4 to 256.
row_headers_width : default ``41``
    The width of the row header column, from 4 to 1024.
row_height : default ``22``
    The height of every row, from 4 to 256.
font
    The font of cell and header text.
read_only : default ``false``
    Whether no cell of the grid edits, toggles or chooses.
allow_user_to_resize_columns : default ``true``
    Whether dragging a column header's divider resizes the column.
first_displayed_row
    The position of the first row shown under the column headers.
    `set_first_displayed_row` scrolls to a position; layout keeps the last
    rows filling the grid.
horizontal_scroll_offset
    How far the cells are scrolled left, in logical units at text scale 1.
displayed_row_end
    One past the last row shown, partly shown rows included.
vertical_scroll_bar
    The child `VScrollBar` that scrolls by rows.
horizontal_scroll_bar
    The child `HScrollBar` that scrolls by logical units.
selection_mode : default cell_select
    `DataGridViewSelectionMode::cell_select` selects cells,
    `full_row_select` whole rows. Changing it selects the current cell (or
    row) alone.
multi_select : default ``true``
    Whether Ctrl and Shift add to the selection.
current_cell
    The cell keyboard input acts on, at its row's present position, or none.
    `set_current_cell` moves it, committing any edit first, and selects it
    alone; it returns false and changes nothing when the edit does not
    commit.
current_row_id
    The current cell's row ID, or none.
selected_cells
    The selected cells at their rows' present positions, by row, then
    column; in full-row mode every cell of every selected row.
selected_rows
    The positions of the selected rows: in full-row mode the selected rows,
    in cell mode the rows whose every cell is selected.
is_current_cell_in_edit_mode
    Whether a text cell is in edit or a combo box cell's choices are open.
editing_control
    The `TextBox` a text cell edits in. It is laid out over the current cell
    only during an edit.
drop_down_open
    Whether a combo box cell's choices are open.
virtual_row_window_source : default none
    The `DataGridViewRowWindowSource` window mode asks for row IDs. Taking it
    away (null) in window mode first takes every ID from the old source and
    goes to edit mode; rows that are not virtual refuse it with
    `std::logic_error`.
row_order_mode : default ``DataGridViewRowOrderMode::edit``
    How the virtual rows' order is held: ``edit`` (every ID, in a chunked
    order index) or ``window`` (the IDs around the displayed rows).
row_order_policy : default ``DataGridViewRowOrderPolicy::automatic``
    Who chooses the mode: the grid, by the thresholds, or the program,
    pinning ``edit`` or ``window``, which is switched to at once. Pinning
    ``window`` without a window source throws `std::logic_error`.
row_order_thresholds
    The automatic policy's `DataGridViewRowOrderThresholds`: window mode
    from ``window_rows`` rows (250000) or ``window_changes`` reported changes
    in one layout pass (20000); edit mode again at most ``edit_rows`` rows
    (100000) with at most ``edit_changes`` changes (1000) in the last pass
    and this one; ``window_margin`` rows (64) held past each end of the
    displayed rows. New thresholds apply at once. Edit thresholds above
    window thresholds throw `std::invalid_argument`.
row_order_statistics
    The order's work counters (`DataGridViewRowOrderStatistics`): reported
    changes, index writes, slot moves, chunk-table rebuilds, whole builds,
    window requests, IDs requested, position queries and mode switches.

Events
------
selection_changed
    Raised once after an operation changes which cells or rows are selected.
current_cell_changed
    Raised after the current cell moves to another cell, with the new cell or
    none; not when only its row's position changes.
cell_begin_edit
    Raised before an edit begins, by F2, typing, a double click, a combo box
    cell opening, or `begin_edit`. Setting ``cancel`` keeps the cell out of
    edit.
cell_end_edit
    Raised when an edit ends, committed or discarded.
cell_validating
    Raised before an edited text cell commits, with the text as typed.
    Setting ``cancel`` refuses it: the cell stays in edit and publishes the
    invalid state.
cell_value_changed
    Raised after a cell's value changes: a committed edit, a toggled check
    box, a chosen item or `set_cell_value`.
cell_content_click
    Raised when the user clicks a button cell or toggles a check box cell.
column_header_click
    Raised when a column header is clicked, with the column's index.
column_width_changed
    Raised after a column's width changes, with the column's index.
row_order_mode_changed
    Raised after the virtual rows' order switched mode, with the old and new
    mode, the reason (``row_count``, ``change_rate``, ``policy`` or
    ``source``), the row count and this pass's reported changes.

Methods
-------
column_index
    The position of the column with a name, or none.
set_column_width
    Sets a column's width; an unknown column throws `std::out_of_range` and a
    width below the column's minimum `std::invalid_argument`.
set_column_sort_glyph
    Shows an ascending or descending sort glyph on a column header, or none.
set_column_read_only
    Makes a column's cells read-only, ending an edit in that column.
add_row
    Appends an unbound row and returns its position. An empty stable ID is
    replaced by a generated one (``row.1``, ``row.2``, ...); a repeated ID,
    invalid UTF-8 or more values than columns throws `std::invalid_argument`.
    Virtual and bound rows refuse it with `std::logic_error`, as they do
    `insert_row`, `set_rows` and `remove_row_at`.
insert_row
    Inserts an unbound row before a position. The current cell and the
    selection stay on their rows.
set_rows
    Replaces the unbound rows, ending any edit and clearing the selection.
remove_row_at
    Removes an unbound row. A selected row leaves the selection; when it held
    the current cell, the row that takes its position, or the new last row,
    becomes current.
clear_rows
    Removes every row of any source and returns to unbound rows.
row_id
    The stable ID of the row at a position: an unbound row's own, the
    application's for a virtual row, the record's for a bound row. A position
    past the end throws `std::out_of_range`.
row_position
    The present position of the row with a stable ID, or none.
cell_value
    A cell's value. A cell past the rows or columns throws
    `std::out_of_range`.
cell_text
    The text a cell shows: numbers in their shortest exact form, and a button
    column's `button_text` for an empty button cell.
set_cell_value
    Stores a value from the program, read-only or not, and raises
    `cell_value_changed` when it differs. Returns false when a provider or
    binding source refuses it.
sort
    Orders unbound rows stably by a column: empty values first, then
    booleans, numbers and text. The column shows the sort glyph and the
    others none; the current cell and the selection stay on their rows.
    Returns false for virtual or bound rows, or when an edit in progress does
    not commit.
set_virtual_rows
    Switches to virtual rows: the application's row IDs in presentation
    order, or a `DataGridViewRowWindowSource` that keeps the order, with
    values asked of a provider by ID. Unbound rows are discarded, and any
    edit, the selection and the current cell end. Given the order, the grid
    starts in edit mode without a window source; given a source, in the
    mode its policy chooses. A null provider or source, or an empty,
    repeated or invalid UTF-8 ID, throws `std::invalid_argument` and changes
    nothing.
set_virtual_row_order
    Replaces the virtual rows' order after the application inserted, removed,
    filtered or sorted rows. The selection, the current cell, an edit in
    progress and the first displayed row stay on their IDs. A selected row
    that is gone leaves the selection; when the current row is gone, its
    edit is discarded and the row now at its position, or the new last row,
    becomes current. It is a reset: the order is rebuilt in edit mode, and
    the policy may move it to window mode again. Rows that are not virtual
    refuse it with `std::logic_error`; an invalid ID throws
    `std::invalid_argument` and changes nothing.
insert_virtual_rows
    Reports rows the application inserted: their IDs now stand at the given
    position onwards. Costs in proportion to the change.
remove_virtual_rows
    Reports rows the application removed. Only they leave the selection;
    when the current row is among them, its edit is discarded and the row
    now at its position, or the new last row, becomes current.
move_virtual_row
    Reports a row the application moved: it now stands at the position.
    The three reports keep the selection, the current cell, an edit and the
    first displayed row on their IDs. In edit mode an invalid report (an
    empty, repeated or invalid UTF-8 ID, a removed or moved row that is not
    there) throws `std::invalid_argument` and a position past the end
    `std::out_of_range`, changing nothing; in window mode the source is
    trusted. Rows that are not virtual refuse them with `std::logic_error`.
refresh_rows
    Repaints after the provider's values changed outside the grid.
is_cell_selected
    Whether a cell is selected; in full-row mode, whether its row is.
is_row_selected
    Whether a row is selected; in cell mode, whether all its cells are.
set_cell_selected
    Selects or deselects a cell (its row in full-row mode). Without
    `multi_select`, selecting clears the rest.
set_row_selected
    Selects or deselects a row, or all its cells in cell mode.
clear_selection
    Deselects everything.
select_all
    Selects every cell, or every row; nothing without `multi_select`.
begin_edit
    Puts the current text cell in edit, its text selected or the caret at
    its end, or opens the current combo box cell's choices. Returns false
    for no current cell, a read-only cell, a check box or button cell, or a
    cancelled `cell_begin_edit`.
end_edit
    Commits the edit in progress: `cell_validating`, conversion to the
    column's `value_kind`, then the value. Returns false, leaving the cell in
    edit and invalid, when any step refuses.
cancel_edit
    Discards the edit in progress.
close_drop_down
    Closes a combo box cell's choices, ending its edit.
initialize_control_tree
    Creates the editor and the scroll bars. `make_control` calls it; do not
    call it yourself.

Notes
-----
Cells are records, not child controls. Only the rows and columns in view are
realized: the grid publishes them as three item systems, ``row`` (the row
header with ``row_header``, ``row_header_label``, ``row_glyph`` and
``row_rule``), ``cell`` (``cell``, ``cell_selection``, ``cell_content``,
``cell_check_well``, ``cell_check_indicator``, ``cell_button_face``,
``cell_button_label``, ``cell_drop_down``, ``cell_drop_down_glyph``,
``cell_vertical_rule``, ``cell_horizontal_rule`` and ``cell_focus``) and
``column`` (``column_header``, ``column_label``, ``sort_glyph``,
``column_divider`` and ``column_grip``), and paints every part through the
by-role paint path (`paint_part`). Cells take the states selected, current,
read_only, invalid, checked, pressed, open and focus_visible; rows selected,
current and read_only; column headers hot, pressed and captured, and the
application-defined ``sorted_ascending`` and ``sorted_descending``. The
column header row and the row header column stay in place while the cells
scroll beneath them.

Rows are identified as in `ObjectView`: by stable ID, with no second
row-ownership model. A virtual grid holds the application's order of row
IDs and an index from ID to position; the application owns the rows and their
values, sorts and filters them itself, and gives the grid the order in full
(`set_virtual_row_order`, a reset), by change (`insert_virtual_rows`,
`remove_virtual_rows`, `move_virtual_row`), or on demand through a window
source.

The order has two modes (owner decision W-5; `DataGridViewRowOrder`). In
edit mode the grid holds every ID in chunks of at most 512 with a Fenwick
tree of their sizes and an ID-to-chunk index, so a reported change costs in
proportion to the change: O(changed rows + 256 + log chunks), plus the
number of chunks when one splits, merges or empties, while a reset costs the
row count. In window mode it holds only the IDs of the displayed rows and
64 rows past each end, fetched from the window source in one request when
the displayed rows leave the window, and asks the source for an ID's
position or a far row's ID one at a time; a reported change only discards
the window. The automatic policy goes to window mode when the rows reach
``window_rows`` or one layout pass's reported changes reach
``window_changes``, and back to edit mode (taking every ID from the source
once) when the rows are at most ``edit_rows`` and the last pass and this one
had at most ``edit_changes`` changes; it decides after each report, reset,
and policy or source change, never during layout, and reports each switch.
A pass counts when the grid is laid out. The selection, the current cell, an
edit, focus and the first displayed row follow their IDs in both modes and
across switches. The grid asks its provider, by ID, only for the
cells it shows, the current cell, and cells the program or accessibility
reads, and realizes only the rows in view: painting a window of a million
rows asks for the values of that window alone (the tests check it). Cell
events carry the row's ID beside its position. A bound grid shows the field
each column's
`data_property_name` names. Its current row follows the source's position
and moves it, and a committed edit moves the position to its row and sets
the field; a record the source does not allow to be edited is read-only.

Keys: the arrows move the current cell, Shift extends the selection from the
anchor and Ctrl jumps to the edge; Tab and Shift+Tab move across and wrap to
the next or previous row, leaving the grid at either end; Home and End go to
the row's first and last cell (the first and last row in full-row mode),
Ctrl+Home and Ctrl+End to the grid's; Page Up and Page Down move by the rows
in view; Enter moves down; Ctrl+A selects all. F2, typing or a double click
edits a text cell; Enter, Tab, an arrow up or down, a click elsewhere or
leaving the grid commits, and Escape discards. When focus leaves for another
control and the text does not commit, the edit is discarded. Space toggles a
check box cell and clicks a button cell; F4 or Alt+Down opens a combo box
cell's choices. `cell_validating` is raised only for an edit being committed.

The grid publishes the accessibility role `table`, with the row count and
the column count, and is `multiselectable` while `multi_select` is on. The
visible column headers are `column_header` children, and each visible row
is a `row` holding its cells: a `text_box`, `check_box` (also
`checkable`), `combo_box` or `button` by column kind, so that each keeps
its editing interface, with its row and column index (counting from 1). A cell's
stable ID is its row's ID, ``.`` and its column's name. Cells take
`SemanticAction::set_value` (text through the same validation and conversion
as typing), `press` (toggle or click) and `expand` (open the choices).

Not supported yet: cell styles and their inheritance, image and link
columns, frozen rows and columns beyond the headers, clipboard copy, sort
modes (the application sorts, or calls `sort` for unbound rows), automatic
column and row sizing, row height resizing, the new-row and row-deletion
editing interface, error icons and cell tool tips.

Examples
--------
A grid of stations with a check box and a combo box column, sorted by name:

.. code-block:: cpp

   std::shared_ptr<gf::DataGridView> grid =
       gf::make_control<gf::DataGridView>(gf::StableId("radio.stations"));
   (*grid).set_columns({
       {.name = "name", .header_text = "Station", .width = 160.0},
       {.name = "favourite", .header_text = "Favourite", .kind = gf::DataGridViewColumnKind::check_box,
        .width = 70.0},
       {.name = "mode", .header_text = "Mode", .kind = gf::DataGridViewColumnKind::combo_box,
        .width = 90.0, .items = {"AM", "FM", "USB"}},
   });
   (*grid).add_row({.stable_id = {"wqxr"}, .cells = {gf::BindingValue{std::string("WQXR")},
                                                     gf::BindingValue{true},
                                                     gf::BindingValue{std::string("FM")}}});
   (*grid).add_row({.stable_id = {"bbc4"}, .cells = {gf::BindingValue{std::string("BBC Radio 4")},
                                                     gf::BindingValue{false},
                                                     gf::BindingValue{std::string("AM")}}});
   (*grid).sort(0U, gf::DataGridViewSortDirection::ascending);   // BBC Radio 4 first
   // row_position({"wqxr"}) is now position 1

Virtual rows: the application owns the rows and their order, and the grid
asks for the values it shows by row ID:

.. code-block:: cpp

   struct Stations final : gf::DataGridViewCellValueProvider {
       gf::BindingValue cell_value(const gf::DataGridViewRowId& row, std::size_t) const override {
           return gf::BindingValue{"Station " + row.value};
       }
       bool push_cell_value(const gf::DataGridViewRowId&, std::size_t, const gf::BindingValue&) override {
           return false;
       }
   };

   void example() {
       std::shared_ptr<gf::DataGridView> grid =
           gf::make_control<gf::DataGridView>(gf::StableId("radio.virtual"));
       (*grid).set_columns({{.name = "name", .header_text = "Station", .width = 160.0}});
       (*grid).set_virtual_rows(std::make_shared<Stations>(), {{"a"}, {"b"}, {"c"}});
       (*grid).set_current_cell(gf::DataGridViewCellAddress{gf::DataGridViewRowPosition{1U}, 0U});
       (*grid).set_virtual_row_order({{"c"}, {"d"}, {"b"}, {"a"}});   // the application sorted and added
       // current_row_id() is still {"b"}, now at position 2
   }
