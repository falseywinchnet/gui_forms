# Install

GUI.Forms is distributed as source. You build it once with the pinned LLVM 22
toolchain, install it to a prefix, and consume that prefix from your own CMake
project through `find_package(GUIForms)`. This page gets you from an empty
machine to an installed SDK. [Building from source](../building/index) covers
every option, the tests and the demonstration programs.

## Supported platforms

| Platform | Minimum | Host | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| macOS | 14.0, Apple silicon (arm64) only | AppKit | Default build on a Mac |
| Windows | 10 (x64) | Win32 | Native build in MSYS2 CLANG64 |
| Linux | Ubuntu 24.04 CI targets (x64, arm64) | X11 | Opt-in; needs X11 and ATK development packages |

Intel Macs are not supported. Wayland sessions need XWayland for the X11
host. The portable core (`Core`, `Controls`, `Drawing`, `Threading`) is host
independent, but its build still requires the pinned LLVM version below.

## Prerequisites

GUI.Forms requires **LLVM 22.1.x**. The configure step fails with any other
compiler, including the system Clang, because the compiler identity is part of
the compiler-cache contract. You also need CMake 3.25 or newer, Ninja, Git,
Python 3.12 or newer and, optionally, `ccache`.

macOS
: Install the Xcode command-line tools and `brew install cmake ninja ccache llvm@22`.
  Put `$(brew --prefix llvm@22)/bin` first on `PATH`. Homebrew's prebuilt
  libc++ targets a newer OS than GUI.Forms supports, so build the matching
  runtimes once and point the toolchain file at them:

  ```sh
  python3 tools/build_macos_runtimes.py --work /tmp/llvm-runtimes \
      --prefix "$PWD/.build/toolchain/llvm-22.1.8-macos14" --jobs 4
  export GUI_FORMS_LLVM_RUNTIME="$PWD/.build/toolchain/llvm-22.1.8-macos14"
  ```

Linux (Ubuntu 24.04)
: Add the `llvm-toolchain-noble-22` repository from apt.llvm.org, then
  install `clang-22 cmake ninja-build ccache generate-ninja pkg-config
  libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libxfixes-dev
  libatk1.0-dev libatk-bridge2.0-dev`. Put `/usr/lib/llvm-22/bin` first on
  `PATH`.

Windows
: Install MSYS2 and, in the CLANG64 environment, the packages listed in
  `tools/windows_toolchain.json` (clang 22.1.8, lld, cmake, ninja, ccache,
  winpthreads). Build from the CLANG64 shell.

On every platform export the compiler explicitly:

```sh
export CC=clang CXX=clang++ OBJCXX=clang++
```

## Configure, build, install

Run all commands from the repository root. Fetch the text sources before
configuring any native build; CMake stops if they are absent:

```sh
sh third_party/fetch_text_stack.sh
sh third_party/fetch_linebreak.sh
```

Then use the configure command for your platform.

macOS (with `GUI_FORMS_LLVM_RUNTIME` set as above):

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/llvm22.cmake \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$PWD/sdk"
```

Linux:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/llvm22.cmake \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$PWD/sdk" \
    -DGUI_FORMS_ENABLE_LINUX_HOST=ON
```

Windows (in MSYS2 CLANG64):

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/llvm22.cmake \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$PWD/sdk" \
    -DGUI_FORMS_ENABLE_WINDOWS_HOST=ON
```

Build, test and install the selected configuration:

```sh
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
cmake --install build
```

The CPU renderer, `stx_skia/`, builds with the tree. HarfBuzz and FreeType
come from the explicit text fetch above. SheenBidi is vendored; libunibreak is needed only for the optional
development text-mask profile. Linux native tests need an X11 display;
use `xvfb-run -a ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure` on a headless runner.

Pass the absolute path to the same `cmake/llvm22.cmake` to every consumer
project. On macOS the toolchain also fixes the SDK, the arm64
architecture, the 14.0 deployment target and the bundled libc++ runtime, and a
consumer built with different settings is not binary compatible.

## What gets installed

| Path under the prefix | Content |
|---|---|
| `include/gui_forms/` | Public portable headers |
| `${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/` (usually `lib/`) | `GUIForms::Core`, `Controls`, `Drawing` (static), `GUIForms::Threading` (shared), `GUIForms::Application` (shared, when a native host is enabled), `GUIForms::Audio` (static, when enabled); Windows runtime DLLs go in `bin/` |
| `${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/cmake/GUIForms/` | `GUIFormsConfig.cmake` and exported target files |
| `share/GUIForms/fonts/` | Bundled font set and licences, installed with a native host; exported as `GUIForms_FONT_DIR` |
| `share/licenses/` | Third-party notices |

Nothing from Skia, AppKit, Win32 or X11 appears in the installed headers;
those remain private adapters inside the `Application` library.

### Package components

`find_package(GUIForms CONFIG REQUIRED COMPONENTS ...)` accepts these
components. A component the prefix lacks fails at configure time with a
message saying which build provides it.

| Component | Target | Installed when |
|---|---|---|
| `Core`, `Controls`, `Drawing`, `Threading` | `GUIForms::Core`, `::Controls`, `::Drawing`, `::Threading` | Always |
| `Application` | `GUIForms::Application` | A native host is enabled |
| `Audio` | `GUIForms::Audio` | `GUI_FORMS_BUILD_AUDIO` (on in CI and in `build_sdk.py`) |
| `TextMasks` | `GUIForms::TextMasks` | `GUI_FORMS_BUILD_TEXT_MASKS` with a native host (`build_sdk.py --features all`) |
| `AudioLoopTransport` | `GUIForms::AudioLoopTransport` | `GUI_FORMS_BUILD_AUDIO_LOOP_TRANSPORT` with audio (`build_sdk.py --features all`) |
| `FreeType`, `HarfBuzz` | `GUIForms::FreeType`, `GUIForms::HarfBuzz` | `GUI_FORMS_INSTALL_TEXT_STACK` with the text engine (`build_sdk.py --features all`) |

`TextMasks` is an interface on `Application`, which already contains the
text-mask service. Link it beside `Application`, never beside `Core`; see
[Consume the SDK](consume-the-sdk). It installs `gui_forms/text_mask.hpp`
and `gui_forms/text_mask/`. It also installs the prepared-text types, layout
and service headers that the text-mask API includes for its vocabulary;
the prepared-text service itself is not installed.

`AudioLoopTransport` names an `Audio` library built with the loop transport.
That `Audio` carries the `GUI_FORMS_AUDIO_LOOP_TRANSPORT` definition, which
`audio.hpp` needs to declare the transport, and installs
`gui_forms/audio/loop_transport/`.

```cmake
find_package(GUIForms 0.2 CONFIG REQUIRED COMPONENTS Application TextMasks Audio AudioLoopTransport)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE GUIForms::Application GUIForms::TextMasks GUIForms::AudioLoopTransport)
```

`FreeType` and `HarfBuzz` are the pinned FreeType 2.14.2 and HarfBuzz 14.6.0
that GUI.Forms' text engine links, for a product that calls them directly.
They install as the static libraries GUI.Forms builds, with its options:
FreeType without zlib, so it refuses gzip-compressed fonts, and HarfBuzz with
its FreeType functions (`hb-ft.h`). Their headers keep the upstream layouts,
`include/freetype2/` and `include/harfbuzz/`, and each target puts its
directory on the include path, so `#include <ft2build.h>` and
`#include <hb.h>` work. `GUIForms::HarfBuzz` links `GUIForms::FreeType`.
GUI.Forms' own libraries hold their own copies, so pass no FreeType or
HarfBuzz object between them and your code. The licences are
`FreeType-FTL.txt` and `HarfBuzz-COPYING.txt` in `share/licenses/GUIForms/`.
FreeType's licence asks a product that ships it to credit it in its
documentation; `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` there carries the credit.

```cmake
find_package(GUIForms 0.2 CONFIG REQUIRED COMPONENTS FreeType HarfBuzz)
target_link_libraries(my_compositor PRIVATE GUIForms::HarfBuzz GUIForms::FreeType)
```

## The source SDK

Each tested release publishes one platform-neutral source SDK,
`gui-forms-sdk-<version>-source.tar.gz`, listed in its `SHA256SUMS.txt`. It
holds one directory, `gui-forms-sdk-<version>/`, containing:

- the release commit's tree, as `git archive` writes it;
- the pinned third-party sources the build would otherwise fetch, each at
  the path its fetch script or CMake file reads first, so configuring from
  the archive fetches none of them:

  | Path | Source | Pinned in |
  |---|---|---|
  | `third_party/harfbuzz/` | HarfBuzz (without its `test/` and `perf/` data, which no GUI.Forms build reads) | `third_party/fetch_text_stack.sh` |
  | `third_party/freetype/` | FreeType | `third_party/fetch_text_stack.sh` |
  | `third_party/libunibreak/` | libunibreak | `third_party/fetch_linebreak.sh` |
  | `third_party/miniaudio/` | miniaudio | `cmake/Audio.cmake` |

- `SDK_MANIFEST.json`, which names the build entry point (`"build":
  "tools/build_sdk.py"`) and the top directory. It also gives each vendored
  source's path, upstream, pinned commit and tree digest, and lists what a
  build still downloads (`network_inputs`) or needs installed
  (`prebuilt_inputs`). Its `revision` is the release commit, and
  `compiler_cache` names that commit's compiler-cache pre-release (see
  [Build with CI's compiler cache](#build-with-cis-compiler-cache)).

The archive carries no Git metadata and no build output. Build and install
GUI.Forms for your host from it:

```sh
tar -xzf gui-forms-sdk-<version>-source.tar.gz
cd gui-forms-sdk-<version>
python3 tools/build_sdk.py --target <platform> --prefix "$HOME/gui-forms-sdk"
```

`<platform>` is one of `macos-arm64`, `windows-x64`, `linux-x64` and
`linux-arm64`. Only the platform of the machine running the build is
accepted until per-target cross-compile toolchains exist.

`build_sdk.py` runs the target's own preparation (the pinned text sources,
unless the source SDK archive already holds them). It then configures the toolkit with
the options CI uses, minus the tests and the demonstration programs, builds
it with `--jobs` jobs in `--work` (default `.build/sdk-<platform>`), and
installs it into `--prefix`. The [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) still apply,
including `GUI_FORMS_LLVM_RUNTIME` on macOS. Consume the installed prefix
as in [Verify the installation](#verify-the-installation).

`--features` chooses which optional components are built:

`default`
: The components CI builds and tests: `Core`, `Controls`, `Drawing`,
  `Threading`, the host's `Application` with the HarfBuzz/FreeType text
  engine, and `Audio` with the stx Vorbis decoder.

`all`
: The default set, plus every optional component a product may link:
  `TextMasks` (`GUI_FORMS_BUILD_TEXT_MASKS`), `AudioLoopTransport`
  (`GUI_FORMS_BUILD_AUDIO_LOOP_TRANSPORT`), and `FreeType` and `HarfBuzz`
  (`GUI_FORMS_INSTALL_TEXT_STACK`). One such install serves every
  product; template_harness's lockstep build uses it.

The prepared-text service (`GUI_FORMS_BUILD_PREPARED_TEXT`) is in neither
set. It cannot be installed, and it changes `Application`'s declarations for
every consumer. The probes, benchmarks, fuzzers and diagnostics build
programs or change behaviour rather than adding a component, so they are left
out as well.

### What a source build still downloads

| Input | Platforms | From |
|---|---|---|
| The LLVM 22.1.8 source tarball, digest pinned in `tools/macos_runtime_manifest.py` | macOS, once | github.com/llvm/llvm-project releases, by `tools/build_macos_runtimes.py`, to build the macOS 14 runtime |

The CPU renderer, `stx_skia/`, is part of the source tree, so nothing is
downloaded for it. On every platform the toolchain itself (LLVM 22.1, CMake,
Ninja, Git and Python) is installed as in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites),
not shipped.

A fully offline build therefore needs only the installed toolchain, and on
macOS an already built `GUI_FORMS_LLVM_RUNTIME` prefix.

### Build with CI's compiler cache

CI compiles every tested commit, and each platform's native job of the push
to main publishes its ccache directory in the commit's compiler-cache
pre-release, `build-<commit>`, as `gui-forms-cache-<platform>.tar.gz`
(`.ccache/` and `cache-manifest.json`). It does so as soon as that platform
passes, and the release that carries the source SDK is published only after
all four have passed. `SDK_MANIFEST.json` records it:

```json
"compiler_cache": {
  "release": "build-<revision>",
  "asset": "gui-forms-cache-{platform}.tar.gz",
  "platforms": ["macos-arm64", "windows-x64", "linux-x64", "linux-arm64"],
  "layout": {"ccache_basedir": "the workspace", "source": "gui_forms",
             "work": ".build/native-{platform}", "note": "..."}
}
```

`release` is `null` when the SDK was packaged outside that push (a tag
build), which cannot promise the caches. A build from the SDK hits the cache
only in CI's layout, with the same LLVM 22.1.8 toolchain:

- the SDK's top directory unpacked as `<workspace>/gui_forms`;
- the cache archive extracted into `<workspace>` (it creates `.ccache/`);
- `CCACHE_DIR=<workspace>/.ccache`, `CCACHE_BASEDIR=<workspace>`,
  `CCACHE_COMPILERCHECK=content`, and `ccache` as the compiler launcher
  (`CMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` and `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER`);
- `python3 gui_forms/tools/build_sdk.py --target <platform> --prefix <dir>
  --work <workspace>/.build/native-<platform>`, which compiles in
  `.build/native-<platform>/gui-forms`,
  as CI does;
- the toolchain's own headers at CI's paths, since they lie outside the
  workspace and their absolute paths are hashed: Homebrew's `llvm@22` on
  macOS, `/usr/lib/llvm-22` on Linux, and on Windows the CLANG64 toolchain
  extracted at `D:\a\_temp\msys64`, where CI's runners restore it.

The cache only accelerates: the source stays authoritative, and a missing
archive, a wrong digest or another layout just means compiling more, with
the same result. Check the archive against the digest GitHub lists for the
asset before extracting it.

## Verify the installation

The repository ships standalone consumer examples that use only the installed
package. Build them against your prefix:

```sh
cmake -S examples/reference -B build-examples -G Ninja \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$PWD/sdk" \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$PWD/cmake/llvm22.cmake"
cmake --build build-examples --parallel
ctest --test-dir build-examples --output-on-failure
```

Three of those tests deliberately configure a consumer that links both the
static core and `Application`; they pass only when CMake rejects the
combination. That rejection is the installed SDK working as intended. See
[Consume the SDK](consume-the-sdk) for the linking rule behind it.
