# Consume the SDK

An application consumes GUI.Forms through the installed CMake package. There
are no private include paths, no archive filenames to list and no generated
glue: `find_package` resolves the components you ask for and CMake checks
that the combination is one the toolkit supports.

## Minimal consumer project

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.25)
project(MyForms LANGUAGES CXX)

find_package(GUIForms 0.2 CONFIG REQUIRED COMPONENTS Application)

add_executable(my_forms main.cpp)
target_compile_features(my_forms PRIVATE cxx_std_20)
target_link_libraries(my_forms PRIVATE GUIForms::Application)
# Keep the selected SDK ahead of any older GUI.Forms installation in the
# compiler's normal include search path.
set_target_properties(my_forms PROPERTIES NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED TRUE)
```

Configure it with the prefix you installed to and the same toolchain file the
SDK was built with:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/sdk \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/gui_forms/cmake/llvm22.cmake
cmake --build build
```

`examples/reference/` in the repository is a complete consumer of this shape
and is built against the installed SDK by CI on every platform.

## Components

| Component | Target | Kind | Use it for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Threading` | `GUIForms::Threading` | shared | `Worker`, `CancellationFlag`, the atomic thread pool. Linked by `Core`, `Application` and `Audio`. |
| `Core` | `GUIForms::Core` | static | The retained tree, events, invalidation, scheduling, resources and the portable host protocol, with no renderer and no native window. |
| `Controls` | `GUIForms::Controls` | static | Stock controls over `Core`. Exports `Drawing`. |
| `Drawing` | `GUIForms::Drawing` | static | Renderer-free geometry, colour, paths, raster storage and command recording. |
| `Application` | `GUIForms::Application` | shared | The native host for your platform. Already contains `Core`, `Controls` and `Drawing`. |
| `Audio` | `GUIForms::Audio` | static | PCM clips, Ogg decoding and a device backend. Links `Threading` only. |

Two consumer shapes follow from the table:

- **Renderer-free consumers** (tests, model code, headless automation) link
  `GUIForms::Controls` or `GUIForms::Core`. They construct and mutate a
  `Window` model but never open a native window.
- **Applications** link `GUIForms::Application` and nothing else from the
  retained set.

## The one linking rule

Never link `GUIForms::Core`, `Controls` or `Drawing` into a program that also
links `GUIForms::Application`, directly or through an adapter library.
`Application` already contains one copy of the retained engine; a second copy
means two sets of control registries, two dispatchers and undefined
behaviour. CMake enforces this at generation time and stops with a diagnostic
naming `ERROR_do_not_link_static_Core_with_Application`. That is a deliberate
rejection, not a missing component.

The rule has one practical consequence for component libraries. An audio
adapter that only needs `Worker` and `AudioClip` links `GUIForms::Audio`,
which exposes `Threading` without the core:

```cmake
add_library(audio_adapter STATIC audio_adapter.cpp)
target_link_libraries(audio_adapter PRIVATE GUIForms::Audio)
target_link_libraries(my_forms PRIVATE GUIForms::Application audio_adapter)
```

## Development text targets

`GUIForms::TextMasks` (the logical text-mask service) and
`GUIForms::PreparedText` (the prepared-text service) both need
`GUI_FORMS_ENABLE_HARFBUZZ_TEXT`.

- `TextMasks` is the `TextMasks` package component of a native-host build
  configured with `GUI_FORMS_BUILD_TEXT_MASKS`, such as
  `tools/build_sdk.py --features all` (see
  [Package components](install.md#package-components)). Installing a
  hostless build with text masks stops with an error.
- `PreparedText` stays development-only. It exists only when your project
  adds the GUI.Forms source tree with `add_subdirectory` and turns
  `GUI_FORMS_BUILD_PREPARED_TEXT` on, and installing such a build stops with
  an error.

They follow the linking rule. In a build with a native host, each is an
interface target that links `GUIForms::Application` and nothing else; the
implementation is already inside the Application library, so link it beside
Application:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(my_forms PRIVATE GUIForms::Application GUIForms::TextMasks)
```

Adding `GUIForms::Core` to that program fails at generation time with a
Core-linkage diagnostic. With `PreparedText` enabled, Application also passes
the `GUI_FORMS_PREPARED_TEXT` definition to its consumers, so your code sees
the declarations the library was built with. In a build without a native host
the two targets carry a static Core instead, for hostless programs, and
cannot be combined with an Application library.
`tests/application_text_consumer/` in the repository is a consumer of this
shape.

## Runtime files to ship

`Threading` and `Application` are shared libraries. Ship them beside your
program and use the same copy for every component:

| Platform | Files | Location |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | `libgui_forms_threading.0.dylib`, `libgui_forms_application.0.dylib` and their versioned targets, plus `libc++.1.dylib`, `libc++abi.1.dylib`, `libunwind.1.dylib` from the runtime prefix | `Your.app/Contents/Frameworks`, with `@executable_path/../Frameworks` rpaths; sign the libraries before the bundle |
| Linux | `libgui_forms_threading.so.0`, `libgui_forms_application.so.0` and the versioned files those symlinks resolve to | the application's runtime library directory |
| Windows | `libgui_forms_threading.dll` and `libgui_forms_application.dll`; they embed the LLVM runtimes and winpthreads, so no runtime DLL comes with them. Your own program needs runtime DLLs only if you link it dynamically (link it with `-static`, as GUI.Forms' programs are, to need none) | beside the executable |

The reference examples stage Windows DLLs with `$<TARGET_RUNTIME_DLLS:...>`
in a post-build step; copy that pattern rather than listing DLL names.

## Fonts

Controls never consult the host font catalogue; they draw only the bundled
faces. Native SDK builds install
the bundled faces at `GUIForms_FONT_DIR` (`share/GUIForms/fonts` under the
prefix). This CMake variable does not configure the runtime search path.
Copy the whole directory, including licences, into your package: macOS reads
`Your.app/Contents/Resources/fonts`; Windows and Linux accept the environment
override `GUI_FORMS_FONT_DIR` or use `fonts/` beside the executable. Linux also
falls back to `../share/GUIForms/fonts` relative to the executable. See
[Text engine](text-engine) for the fixed font set.

## Rebuild consumers with the SDK

The public C++ surface is pre-1.0. Object layouts of `Component`, `Event`
slots, `Control` and several controls change between releases, so a consumer
compiled against one SDK is not binary compatible with the next. Rebuild your
application whenever you install a new SDK, and keep the toolchain file the
same on both sides. Header-aware compiler caches invalidate stale objects
automatically; importing a cache does not repair an ABI mismatch.
