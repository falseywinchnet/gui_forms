# Update scopes and dirtiness

Every mutation in GUI.Forms records exactly what it invalidated, and the
window decides when to act on those records. This is what keeps a retained
toolkit cheap: a text change does not re-lay-out an unrelated panel, and ten
property changes in a row do not cause ten layout passes.

## The dirty vocabulary

`Dirty` is a typed bit set declared in `gui_forms/dirty.hpp`:

| Flag | Means the control needs |
|---|---|
| `measure` | its preferred size recomputed |
| `arrange` | its children repositioned |
| `paint` | its pixels repainted |
| `hit_test` | its hit-test shape rechecked |
| `text` | its text shaped again |
| `style` | its visual recipe re-resolved |
| `resource` | an image or font resource reloaded |
| `semantics` | its semantic (accessibility) node rebuilt |
| `accessibility` | its native accessibility publication refreshed |

`Dirty::layout` is `measure | arrange`. The `invalidation` namespace names the
combinations setters actually use: `invalidation::bounds` is measure, arrange,
paint, hit test, semantics and accessibility; `invalidation::enabled` is paint,
hit test, semantics and accessibility; `invalidation::text_content` adds `text`
to the bounds set; `invalidation::paint_only` is paint alone. Stock setters
pick the narrowest correct set.

## Three ways to invalidate

`invalidate(Dirty)`
: Marks this control and the path to the root. This is what setters call.

`invalidate_subtree(Dirty)`
: Marks every descendant too. Use it when a change to this control changes
  how its children must be measured or painted, such as a font change on a
  container.

`invalidate_declared(Dirty)`
: For custom controls. Pass the effects of the mutation at the call site.
  A nonempty mask is forwarded to `invalidate`; there is no separate property
  declaration against which it is checked. Passing `Dirty::none` increments
  `MetricsSnapshot::undeclared_mutations` for an attached control and throws
  without `NDEBUG`; with `NDEBUG`, it invalidates the conservative subtree set.

Marks are coalesced per control. Marking paint twice costs one entry;
`MetricsSnapshot::dirty_marks` counts the marks and `mutations` counts the
setter calls, so the ratio shows how much coalescing is happening.

## Update scopes

`Window::begin_update()` returns a move-only `UpdateScope`. While any scope is
open the window records dirtiness but performs no layout and publishes no
damage. Closing the outermost scope (or letting it go out of scope) runs one
bounded flush. Scopes nest; an inner close does nothing but decrement depth.

```cpp
{
    gf::UpdateScope scope = window.begin_update();
    (*status).set_text("Working…");
    (*progress).set_value(0.0);
    (*cancel).set_enabled(true);
}   // one layout pass, one damage publication
```

Inside a scope you may call `scope.perform_layout()` to force layout early
when you need arranged geometry mid-transaction. Reading arranged or absolute
bounds outside a scope triggers the layout read barrier, which flushes pending
layout before returning; `MetricsSnapshot::read_barrier_flushes` counts those
reads so you can see when a hot loop is accidentally forcing layout.

`begin_init()` / `end_init()` on a control is the related per-control
transaction. During initialization the control's state events coalesce by
event identity and publish once, in first-event order, after the outer
`end_init()`. Entering initialization also revokes the control's focus and
capture and makes it ineligible for routed input until commit. This is the
mechanism behind designer-style staged construction and behind the
`loaded()` ordering described in [Lifecycle](lifecycle).

## Bounded flushes

A flush is not a loop until clean. It runs at most a fixed number of
measure/arrange passes; a layout that keeps dirtying itself hits the pass
limit, the window keeps the last consistent geometry, and
`MetricsSnapshot::bounded_pass_limit_hits` increments. The same bound applies
to callback arbitration: handlers that mutate state during a flush are
retried a bounded number of times (`callback_arbitration_retries`,
`callback_arbitration_limit_hits`). The toolkit never spins; it stops and
reports.

The flush order is fixed: measure dirty controls (top down, preferred sizes
flow up), arrange dirty containers, then convert paint marks into damage
rectangles per paint plane. Hit-test and semantics marks are consumed lazily
by the next hit test or snapshot. Text marks are consumed during measure,
because shaping determines size.

## What a flush produces

After a flush the window holds a `DamageRegion` per paint plane. The host
asks for it with `take_damage()`. The current paint API takes a rectangle,
so a host may paint the region's bounding box, including gaps. If no native host is
attached (tests, headless automation), the damage simply accumulates until
something calls `paint`. Painting is described in
[Painting and damage](painting-and-damage).

## Reading the counters

`Window::metrics_snapshot()` returns a `MetricsSnapshot` with, among others:

- `update_scopes_started`, `update_scope_depth`, `maximum_update_scope_depth`
- `flush_count`, `read_barrier_flushes`, `bounded_pass_limit_hits`
- `measure_passes`, `arrange_passes`, `controls_measured`, `controls_arranged`
- `dirty_marks`, `mutations`, `undeclared_mutations`

`to_json()` serializes the whole snapshot. The `print_metrics_on_close`
window option writes it to the log when the window closes, and the optional
diagnostics panel shows it live. A claim that a change "is cheaper" is made by comparing these
numbers for the same workload, not by inspection.
