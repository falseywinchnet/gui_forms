// the control still paints the item's plate, selection and focus cue by
// role, and the application paints only what lies inside the item's
// content rectangle. Windows Forms' OwnerDrawFixed and ListView.OwnerDraw

// cue. `painter` is the control's, borrowed for the call, in the control's
// local coordinates and clipped to `content`; the handler draws with it and
// does not keep it. `content` is the item's content rectangle in local
// coordinates. `index` is the item's position in the control's model and
// `stable_id` its identity, borrowed for the call; `column` is the column
// of a cell in a view with columns (0 for the item's own content, n for its
// sub-item in column n, as Windows Forms' DrawSubItem), else 0. `states`
// are the item's anatomy states, and `text` and `font` are the colour and
// font the control's default content uses for them, so that owner-drawn
// text can match. A handler sets `draw_default` to have the control draw
// its default content over what the handler drew.
//
// A handler paints only: it must not change, dispose or re-parent the
// control, or anything else in its window, while the event is raised.
