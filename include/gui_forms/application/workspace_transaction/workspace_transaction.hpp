// One coherent change across several windows of a run (stage DK decision 9,
// docking study 5.3): a move that empties one window and fills another lays
// out each window once, never shows a half-moved state, and tells observers
// once, at the end.
//
// While the transaction is open, every included window holds an update
// scope, so its layout waits; windows opened through the transaction are
// created hidden and included; shows, destructions and notifications are
// queued. commit() then runs, in this order:
//
//   1. close the update scopes, in inclusion order: each window lays out once;
//   2. show the windows queued for showing (opened visible, or show_window),
//      without activating them;
//   3. destroy the windows queued for destruction, so a panel moving between
//      two windows is never invisible;
//   4. run the queued notifications once each, in the order queued. A
//      notification that changes windows starts a transaction of its own.
//
// The destructor commits a transaction left open. Every member runs on the
// run's UI thread. The transaction borrows the included Window models; a
// window destroyed through the transaction is destroyed only after its
// scope closed, and the hosts release a model no earlier than the end of
// the turn in which its window closed.
