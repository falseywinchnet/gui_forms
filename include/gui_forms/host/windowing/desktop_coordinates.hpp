// Desktop logical coordinates (stage DK decision 7).
//
// Window frames, the pointer's desktop position and the work areas the
// windowing seam publishes are in one desktop space: origin at the top left
// of the primary monitor, y growing downwards, in logical units. Some hosts
// address their desktop in device pixels (Windows with per-monitor DPI
// awareness, X11); there is no single logical desktop when monitors have
// different scales, so the mapping is per monitor:
//
//   - each monitor keeps its device origin;
//   - its extent is its device extent divided by its scale.
//
// With scales of at least 1, every logical monitor lies inside its device
// rectangle, so monitors that do not overlap on the device desktop do not
// overlap in logical units. A monitor scaled above 1 leaves a gap towards a
// neighbour on its right or below; a point in a gap, or outside every
// monitor, maps through the nearest monitor. With one scale everywhere and
// the primary monitor at the origin the mapping is a plain division. A host
// whose desktop is already logical (macOS points) uses its monitors as they
// are.
//
// Monitor records from HostServices::query_monitors stay in the host's
// device desktop units, as they always were; HostWindowing::query_monitors
// returns the same monitors in logical units.

// The monitor `device` in logical units: same id, origin and scale; frame
// and work area extents divided by the scale. The work area keeps its
// offset from the monitor origin divided by the scale, so it stays inside
// the logical frame.
