// adapter reports application activation, the primary window's minimized
// state and every frame, and the base class decides which floating windows
// are shown and where they move, calling show_impl, hide_impl and
// request_frame_impl. Following works the same whether or not the platform
// also moves owned windows itself (macOS child windows do): a floating
// window's offset is learnt only from moves of the floating window itself,
// never from a move the primary window caused.
//
// Every member runs on the thread that constructed the object. Requests
// from another thread report wrong_thread; requests after shutdown()
// report after_shutdown; unknown or retired identities are
