// The command routing chain (owner decision DK-29). A window offers a
// routed command to command targets in this order, and the first target
// holding a handler for the command's identity (Command::stable_id) runs
// it:
//
// 1. the focused route: the focused control, then each of its ancestors up
//    to the root, for every one that carries a target
//    (Control::set_command_target);
// 2. the active panel, 3. the active document, 4. the main window: one
//    target each, named on the window (Window::set_command_target).
//
// When no target handles it, Command::execute_routed raises the command's
// own `invoked` event, as Command::execute does, so a window with nothing
// registered routes every command exactly as before the chain existed.
// Menus, the ribbon, tool strips, shortcuts, buttons bound to a command
// (ButtonBase::bind, CommandBinding), gallery commits and the notification
// area's menus route their commands (owner decision DK-47); a
// docking workspace names the active panel and document. A floating window
// names its main window's targets for the last three stages, so a document
// command reaches the active document from there.
