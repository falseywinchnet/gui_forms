// How a paint group's image joins what lies beneath it, through the shared
// ADR-004 blend (detail::composite_part_raster):
// - source_over: premultiplied source-over;
// - plus (E7r): each premultiplied channel, alpha included, added to the
//   one beneath and clamped at 255. The engine's cross-fade draws a part's
//   old face at 1 - t and its new face in a plus group at t, inside one
//   isolated group, so that the two sum to one face.
// - multiply and screen (E9.6, CSS `mix-blend-mode`): CSS's separable
//   blend modes, composited as CSS composites them. With s and d the
//   premultiplied source and destination channels and αs and αd their
//   alphas, multiply gives s × (1 − αd) + d × (1 − αs) + s × d, screen
//   gives s + d − s × d, and both give alpha αs + αd − αs × αd. A theme
//   rule's `blend` property (blend_property) draws a part through one.
// - copy (stage T5): the group's image replaces what lies beneath it within
//   the group's clipped bounds, transparent pixels included, as Porter-Duff
//   "source" does; a partly covered edge pixel keeps the rest of what lay
//   beneath. A window granted a non-opaque backdrop paints its backplane in
//   a copy group, so that its frame starts clear. Theme data never selects
//   it.

// A paint group (T2 plan, E7; owner, 2026-10-21: "there are other things that

// - `bounds`, in the current coordinates when the group begins, limits the
//   group. It is given up front so that a painter sizes its storage once:
//   nothing the group draws outside `bounds` (or outside the clip in force
//   at its beginning) is shown.
// - `opacity` in [0, 1] multiplies the group's whole image. Below 1 the group
//   is isolated: its commands draw into a transparent premultiplied image the
//   size of its clipped bounds, which is composited once at `opacity` by
//   `composite`, so overlapping commands never show through one another. At
