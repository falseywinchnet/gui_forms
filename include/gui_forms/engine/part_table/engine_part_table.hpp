// One window's records of the parts the engine has painted with a key (T2
// plan, EnginePartTable). A record is the engine's memory of one part from
// frame to frame. E2 keeps its last states, its preparation, its cached
// raster and the paint on which it was last drawn; later phases add the
// time it entered each state (E3) and its transitions (E7).
//
// A part painted without a key has no record and is drawn statically: no
// cached raster either.
//
// Bounds. A part that is not an item's is one of its control's declared
// parts, so those records are bounded by the window's controls and released
// with them. Item parts are bounded by maximum_item_part_records: a
// virtualized control can paint any number of items over time, so beyond
// the cap the least recently painted item record is evicted, as if
// released. A record whose motion is unsettled (motion_unsettled) is never
// evicted; the table then holds more than the cap until its motion settles.
// No control publishes when it unrealizes an item yet, so records are
// released only by eviction and by their control leaving the window.
//
// The raster cache (GIVEN F2-1): a record keeps the raster its primitive
// last drew while what drew it is unchanged, and reuses the raster's
// storage when it must draw again at the same size. The table holds at most
// raster_cache_budget_bytes of cached rasters and evicts the least recently
// painted part's raster first to make room. A raster is invalidated by
// generation: invalidate_raster() for one part, invalidate_rasters() for the
// whole table (a theme change). A raster's transparency passes through as
// its own premultiplied alpha when it is composited. Releasing or evicting a
// record releases its raster.
//
// The shared bakes (E7r, owner 2026-10-22): rasters the table owns and
// every part may use, keyed by the request that drew them, held within
// shared_bake_budget_bytes with the least recently used evicted first. A
// theme change (invalidate_rasters) drops them all; invalidating one part
// bakes again the shared raster it uses. They are of two kinds.
// - Slice references. A primitive that slices (EnginePrimitive::slice_plan)
//   bakes one reference per distinct request less its sliced lengths: per
//   material, state and scale, say, for every button of a material,
//   whatever their widths. A part's raster is assembled from it by copying
//   (its corners and edges as they are, its centre repeated) and cached
//   like any other. Labels, icons and the focus ring are parts of their
//   own, drawn over the face, so they never split a face's reference.
// - Keyframes (PartRasterRequest::shared). A part whose animated parameters
//   stand at keyframe levels, or whose ambient effect is at one of its loop's
//   frames, uses the shared raster for its request as its own, with no copy;
//   parts of the same size and state share them.

// Which record a handle names: a slot of the table and the slot's
// generation when the record was made. Releasing a record advances its
// slot's generation, so a handle kept past the release is stale and finds
// nothing, even after the slot is reused.
