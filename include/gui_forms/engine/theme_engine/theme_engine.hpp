// The theme engine's entry point (T2 plan, ThemeEngine). paint_part hands it
// every part; controls never call it directly.
//
// Ownership: a Theme owns its engine, and every window showing the theme
// shares it. An application's windows share one theme (ApplicationResources),
// so they share one engine. The engine is immutable once its theme is made:
// it holds the theme's compiled rules (the cascade, E4), below them the
// engine's own built-in rules (built_in_theme_rules, E7), and borrows the
// built-in primitive registry. What changes from frame to frame belongs to
// each window's EnginePartTable and MotionClock.
//
// The engine draws a part with a primitive only when the cascade selects a
// registered primitive for the part, its parameters validate, the cost is
// within budget (GIVEN F1-1) and the presentation is not forced high
// contrast. In every other case the built-in recipe draws it: the body
// paint_part had before the engine existed. A theme with no rules of its
// own draws every part with the built-in recipe except those the built-in
// rules address: the ribbon's command faces and group buttons, which take
// the dithered bulge and its rise, and the docking tiles, which fade in.
//
// A keyed part's transitions run on its window's motion clock (E7): the
// part's states select each machine's state, the property moves toward it,
// and the part repaints within its extent as it moves. Its opacity
// multiplies a primitive's composite in the shared blend; a part the
// built-in recipe draws is drawn as one paint group (Painter::begin_group)
// composited once at that opacity. A part painted without a key stands at
// its machines' targets and its ambient effect's pose.
