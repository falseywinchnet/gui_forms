// One site of a docking layout in one window (stage DK phase D2; owner
// decisions DK-18 to DK-23, DK-28 to DK-30, DK-41): binary splits separated
// by seams, tool stacks with captions and, in the main site, the one
// document area with its document stacks, each stack a PageView over the
// stack's panels. A site realizes either the main site (the first
// constructor) or one floating site (the second; phase D4, normally made by
// the workspace as the root of that site's floating window).
//
// The site borrows its workspace: the workspace must outlive it, or be
// destroyed first, which unbinds the site (it then shows nothing). The site
// realizes its tree after every layout change (the workspace tells it):
// one PageView per
// stack (`<site id>.stack.<node id>`), reused while the stack keeps its node
// identity, its pages the stack's panels in order with the stack's
// selection; tool stacks show their tabs at the bottom only when they hold
// two or more panels, document stacks at the top. A panel's content is its
// workspace control, created when the panel is first shown selected (lazy
// creation).
//
// A floating site (phase D4; owner decisions DK-1, DK-6 to DK-12, DK-41):
// no document area, side strips, collapsing, maximizing or window-edge
// targets; it shows nothing once its site leaves the layout. Its tool
// stacks keep their drawn captions (the one-stack floating window's caption
// of T6-3; the host's title bar stays too, since no host offers a frameless
// owned window yet). A double-click on a floating caption docks the stack
// back where its panel was docked last. While the site holds exactly one
// tool stack, dragging its caption moves the window itself with the
// framework's capture drag (WindowFrameDrag, decision 12) where the host
// supports it, the targets of the window under the pointer showing as for
// any drag; elsewhere the caption drags the stack as in the main site. Keys
// a floating site's window does not take go to the main window's
// accelerators.
//
// Drags across windows (phase D4; decision 41, T8-3): while the workspace
// has windows attached, a drag follows the desktop pointer: the topmost
// site under it (ApplicationWindows::window_at) shows the targets, tiles and
// tint, only over its hovered pane (its window edges too when it is the
// main site), and the stamp; the other sites show none. A release on a target
// in another window applies that target's edit, as one user transaction
// across the windows; a release where nothing accepts floats the subject
// into a new floating window at the pointer, the panel's size, when it may
// float (DockWorkspace::can_float), and snaps it back otherwise (the rejected
// cue shows only then).
//
// Auto-hide (stage DK phase D5; owner decisions DK-27, DK-28, DK-41, DK-42):
// each window edge holding auto-hidden panels shows a side strip, a PageStrip
// (`<site id>.side.<edge>`) with one tab per panel, the auto-hidden stacks in
// layout order and their panels in stack order; left and right strips turn
// their labels (bottom to top on the left, top to bottom on the right). The
// strips take their band from the site's edges, left and right the full
// height and top and bottom between them; the tree is laid out in what
// remains. A side tab opens its panel's flyout: an in-window overlay that
// slides out from the strip over the tree in `flyout_slide_duration`
// (linear until the motion of stage T2; at once under reduced motion),
// casting the overlay shadow, holding the stack's caption (its pin unchecked
// for an auto-hidden stack), the panel and a grip on its inner edge. The
// flyout opens when the pointer rests on a tab for `flyout_hover_delay`
// (unless the workspace's flyout_opening is click), at once on a click, or
// on Enter or Space on a focused tab (each strip is a focus region; its
// arrow keys move without opening). Opened by click, keyboard or program,
// focus moves into the panel; opened by hover, focus stays where it was
// until the user clicks inside. A flyout without focus closes
// `flyout_leave_delay` after the pointer leaves it and its tab; one with
// focus stays until focus leaves it. A press outside the flyout and the
// strips closes it and goes on to what was pressed. Escape inside closes it
// and returns focus to the control that had it before (not a side strip),
// else to the active document. The grip resizes the flyout within the tree's
// extent; the new extent lasts for the session (the layout is not edited).
// Opening, resizing and closing a flyout never edit the layout: a group's
// side tab shows that panel without changing the stack's selection.
//
// The pin of a root-level tool stack's caption auto-hides the whole stack
// (E4-1) as one user transaction, onto the window edge nearest the stack,
// with the stack's extent across that edge; the pin of a flyout of an
// auto-hidden stack returns the stack to where it stood (DockEdit::unpin),
// so a pin and an unpin with nothing between leave the layout exactly as it
// was.
//

// Parts: seams (item system `seam`), 3 units, with a grip of dots, between
// the two children of each split; a seam is dragged with the pointer or,
// while the site has focus, moved with the arrow keys (Tab and Shift+Tab
// step between seams), within both sides' minimums (DockLayout's solver).
// Each tool stack has a caption (item system `stack`): the identity key,
// the selected panel's title, the position menu, the pin (root-level items
// only, owner decision DK-28: checked while docked; pressing it auto-hides
// the stack) and close (which hides the panel). The caption of the stack holding the
// active panel is `current`: the look (a pale tint with a 2-unit accent line
// on top, decision DK-41) is the default theme's (T4); until then it paints
// through paint_part with today's recipes.
//
// Shrinking: when the site is smaller than the tree's minimum, tool stacks
// collapse in increasing collapse priority (the largest priority of their
// panels; ties collapse the later stack in tree order first) until the rest
// fits (owner decision DK-23). A collapsed stack goes behind side tabs on
// the window edge nearest the place it would have in the tree, as if
// auto-hidden, and opens in a flyout like one; the layout model is unchanged
// (the stack stays docked, its flyout's pin checked: pressing it auto-hides
// the stack for good), and the stack returns to the tree when room returns.
// The side strips' bands are taken before the collapse is planned, so a
// collapse that adds a strip is planned again with that band. A stack whose
// collapse would not reduce the shortfall is kept. The maximized document
// area hides the tool stacks in place, without side tabs.
//
// Keyboard (owner decision DK-30), while focus is in the site: F6 and
// Shift+F6 move between the stacks (each a focus region of the window, in
// tree order) and then the side strips (left, top, right, bottom); Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab open the navigator on the
// documents, Alt+F7 and Alt+Shift+F7 on the tool panels, and releasing the
// modifier activates the current row; Ctrl+F6 and Ctrl+Shift+F6 activate the
// next and previous document in most-recently-used order (DK-46); Escape
// in a tool panel (unless its content used it) returns to the active
// document, Shift+Escape hides
// the active tool panel; Ctrl+Shift+F12 toggles the maximized document area
// (every tool stack hidden, as by collapsing, and restored); Alt+Hyphen,
// Shift+F10 and the context-menu key open the active panel's position menu.
// A focused TabControl keeps Ctrl+Tab (PageView's Ctrl+Tab policy is `pass`
// inside the site). Every key but F6 is a named keyboard command
// (KeyCommand, G6-1), so the window's key map, as the host reports it and
// the application rebinds it, decides the chords; the navigator commits on
// the release of the chord's Ctrl, Alt or Meta.
//
// Activation: focus entering a stack (a click, Tab, F6, a tab chosen)
// makes its selected panel the workspace's active panel; a press on a
// caption activates it too.
//
// Semantics: each stack is a `pane` named by its selected panel (the
// document stacks "Documents"), holding the PageView's tab list and tab
// panel and its caption buttons; each seam is a `split_pane` with its
// position as the value and increment, decrement and set_value.
//
// Dragging (phase D3; owner decisions DK-24 to DK-26, DK-30, DK-41): a press
// on a caption that moves the drag threshold (4 units, D5-1) drags the whole
// stack; a tab dragged off its strip drags one panel (D7-1). A tool stack's
// strip does not reorder, so its tab drag is claimed at once
// (page_drag_started); a document strip reorders by its live slide until the
// pointer leaves the strip's band, and then the panel tears off. At the
// start the subject leaves its place and the place closes up in one layout
// pass of the site; the layout model is unchanged until the drop (docking
// study 5.1, invariant 4), so Escape leaves it as it was. A miniature of the
// panel (its caption strip by role over a picture of its view, taken with
// Window::snapshot_control as the drag starts; the content well where the
// window cannot snapshot) is interpolated from the panel's rectangle down to a stamp about 100 units
// long over 220 ms and follows the pointer; at the drop it grows into the
// panel's new place, on Escape back into its old one; reduced motion skips
// the motion. Targets (DockDropTarget, planned when the drag starts and at
// every layout pass): over the hovered pane only, a cross of five quiet
// tiles (top, left, tab into, right, bottom) appears, fading in over 100 ms;
// the pointer's position within the pane (or the tile under it) selects
// one, which is lit; the main window's edges are global targets with a tile
// at each edge's middle; the area the subject would take is tinted. Targets
// the restrictions refuse are not planned and their tiles are disabled.
// Ctrl held suppresses docking. A release on a target applies one user
// transaction and activates the moved panel; a release elsewhere snaps
// back. Escape, losing the pointer capture, the window deactivating and a
// layout change by the program cancel.
//
// The keyboard move mode (G3-1, docking study 5.7.1): the position menu's
// Move or the move_panel key command (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+M) on the active
// panel. The arrows step through the current pane's tiles (Left and Right
// along left, centre, right; Up and Down along top, centre, bottom), Tab and
// Shift+Tab to the next and previous pane and then the window edges, over
// exactly the targets the pointer reaches; each step updates the preview and
// the announcement (drag_announcement, also the site's semantic
// description while a drag runs). Enter commits through the same
// transaction as a drop; Escape cancels.
// position as the value and increment, decrement and set_value. A side strip
// is a tab list (vertical on the left and right) named "Auto-hidden panels";
// an open flyout's stack is a `pane` named by its panel, with the caption's
