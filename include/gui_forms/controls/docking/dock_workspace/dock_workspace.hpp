// The docking workspace (owner decisions DK-3, DK-29, DK-34): a component

// content each created panel holds, and the activation tracks with their
// most-recently-active histories. A DockSite realizes the main site in a
// window, and one DockSite per floating site realizes it in its floating
// window; the workspace names, on every site's window's command routing
// chain, the command targets of the active panel and the active document
// (the targets their content controls carry, Control::set_command_target),
// so a document command such as Save reaches the active document from a
// focused tool panel, floating or not.
//
// Lazy creation: a panel's factory runs the first time the panel is shown
// selected in a realized stack (main or floating) or in a flyout, never for
// a panel that stays behind another tab, hidden, collapsed or behind a side
// tab without its flyout opening. The workspace keeps each created control
// until the panel is closed (close_panel, or a document leaving the layout);
// hiding keeps it.
//
// Edits are model transactions (apply, or the named operations below); the
// layout publishes one change per transaction, after which the workspace
// prunes its histories and moves an active panel or document that left the
// layout to the next in its history (cause fallback), and then the sites
// realize the change: the main site first, then the floating sites in the
// order they were bound. A change whose edits only set floating frames
// (DockLayoutChange::frames_only) moves the floating windows and realizes
// nothing. One main DockSite and one DockSite per floating site may be bound
// at a time.
//
// Floating windows (stage DK phase D4; owner decisions DK-1, DK-6 to DK-12,
// DK-41, DK-44): once attach_windows binds the run's main window, the
// workspace keeps one owned floating window per floating site of the layout.
// Each change is carried out as one WorkspaceTransaction across the windows
// (decision 9): the sites realize the change with every window's layout
// held, a floating site new to the layout gets a window opened hidden (its
// root a DockSite for the site, `<workspace id>.floating.<site id>`, sharing
// the main window's ApplicationResources and key bindings), and at the
// commit every window lays out once, the new windows are shown, and then the
// windows whose sites left the layout are destroyed, so a panel moving from
// a floating window into another window appears before its old window
// closes. A floating window holding a document is a floating document
// window (it stays visible while the application is inactive); any other is
// a floating tool window, which hides then (HostWindowFloating, W0b); the
// kind is chosen when the window opens. Its client area is the site's frame,
// moved if needed so its caption is reachable in a work area
// (place_on_monitor, decision 34); its title is the first stack's selected
// panel's. A move or resize of a floating window, by the user or the host,
// is written to the layout as set_floating_frame (a user edit, allowed
// under the docking lock) with the monitor its centre is on; a frame the
// program sets is requested from the window. The close button of a floating
// window hides its tool panels and closes its documents (one user
// transaction, after the close request returns), which closes the window;
// with no main site bound, the transaction runs inside the request and the
// host closes the window.
// Keys a floating window's own route and accelerators do not take are
// offered to the main window's accelerators (Window::offer_accelerators),
// so shortcuts such as Ctrl+S work from a floating tool window (F2-1).
//
// Execution: one UI thread, the run's; nothing is synchronized.
