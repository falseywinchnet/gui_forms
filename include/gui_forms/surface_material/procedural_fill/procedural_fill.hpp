// scale from these alone, in integer arithmetic, so that its bytes are the
// same on every host; each scale is generated, never resampled from
// another.
//
// - `seed` chooses the noise; equal parameters give equal bytes.
// - `tile` is the pattern's repeat in logical units: the side of its
//   square tile, round(tile × scale) device pixels, within [2, 256]; a
//   pinstripe's period. The fresco covers the box and does not read it.
// - `strength` in [0, 1] scales how far the figure departs from the
//   ground; for the fresco, its blooms' opacity.
// - The ground is the pattern's base colour, and what the fill draws, as
//   a solid, until its pattern is ready; the figure is its contrasting
//   colour (fibres, grain, stripes, streaks); the fresco also reads
//   `accent`, its gradient's last stop, and `bloom`, whose alpha is its
//   blooms' peak opacity.
