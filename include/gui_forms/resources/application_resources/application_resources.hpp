// names the same image, an ImageList belongs to all of them and a theme set
// on one is the theme of all, so a control subtree moved from one window to
// another keeps its images and its look. A Window constructed without one
// makes its own, so a single-window program behaves as before.
//
// Ownership: shared by the windows (and by anyone else holding it); the
// registry and its images live until the last holder releases it. Each
// Window registers itself while it lives and the list only observes them.
// Every member runs on the thread that constructed the object, which must be
// the windows' UI thread.
