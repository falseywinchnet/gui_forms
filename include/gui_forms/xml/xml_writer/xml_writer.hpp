// children nor text, character data on the element's own line, and the same
// escaping every time, so writing what read_xml returned for a written
// document reproduces it byte for byte. Names, values, counts and depth are
// validated against limits; an element with both children and text is
// refused with XmlError::mixed_content. On failure the text is empty.
