"""Archive the GUI.Forms source SDK: the release's tree plus its pinned third-party sources.

One platform-neutral archive, gui-forms-sdk-<version>-source.tar.gz, from
which a consumer builds GUI.Forms for its own host with tools/build_sdk.py:

  gui-forms-sdk-<version>/
    ...                         the release commit's tree (git archive)
    third_party/harfbuzz/       HarfBuzz at fetch_text_stack.sh's pin (test/ and perf/ left out)
    third_party/freetype/       FreeType at fetch_text_stack.sh's pin
    third_party/libunibreak/    libunibreak at fetch_linebreak.sh's pin
    third_party/miniaudio/      miniaudio at cmake/Audio.cmake's pin
    SDK_MANIFEST.json           the build entry point, every vendored source with
                                its pin and tree digest, what a build still
                                downloads (network_inputs) or needs installed
                                (prebuilt_inputs), and the compiler-cache
                                release built from the same tree (compiler_cache)

Each vendored source sits at the in-tree path its fetch script or CMake file
reads first, so configuring from the archive fetches none of them. Pins are
read from those files, never repeated here. The archive is reproducible:
entries in name order, one fixed time, no owner.

compiler_cache names the build-<revision> pre-release whose per-platform
ccache archives CI compiled from this tree, and the layout a build must use
to hit them. Each platform's native job of the push to main that tested the
revision publishes its archive there as soon as it passes, and the release
that carries this SDK is published only after all four have passed, so a
release packaged in that run (--compiler-cache) has all four. A packaging
outside that run (a tag build) cannot promise them, and records release null.

tools/publish_tested_release.py expects the archive under sdk_archive_name()
and lists it in SHA256SUMS.txt. --check reads an existing archive and checks
its shape and every vendored digest.
