# GUI.Forms Linux validation VM

A Lima definition for building and graphically testing GUI.Forms on Linux:
Alpine 3.24.2 aarch64 (musl libc), Apple Virtualization framework, 4 CPUs,
4 GiB memory, 24 GiB sparse disk, headless X11 (Xvfb) and Wayland (Weston with
XWayland).

## Provenance

The previous VMs were lost: the Lima instance `gui-forms-linux` (Ubuntu 24.04,
4 CPUs, 4 GiB, read-only project mount; its directory was deleted before
2026-10-01) and the QEMU Alpine 3.24 VM `paint-builder` from
`~/Developer/Projects/rainstar-linux-lab` on the M4 (disk image gone). This
definition keeps `gui-forms-linux`'s name and size and `paint-builder`'s
Alpine/musl guest and package set, recovered from the session records that
created them. It is kept in the repository so it cannot be lost again.

## Use (on the M4)

```sh
limactl create --name=gui-forms-linux gui_forms/tools/linux_vm/gui-forms-linux.yaml
limactl start gui-forms-linux
limactl shell gui-forms-linux
```

`~/Developer/CodexBuilds` is mounted read-only at `/mnt/codexbuilds`. Copy or
build from there into the guest's home directory; never write the mount.

Clang 22 lives in `/usr/lib/llvm22/bin`:

```sh
export PATH=/usr/lib/llvm22/bin:$PATH CC=clang CXX=clang++
```

Graphical tests run against a headless server, for example:

```sh
Xvfb :2 -screen 0 1280x800x24 -nolisten tcp &
DISPLAY=:2 dwm &
DISPLAY=:2 ctest --test-dir ~/build/gui-forms --output-on-failure
DISPLAY=:2 xwd -root -silent > ~/results/screen.xwd
```

Weston provides Wayland with XWayland when a test needs it:

```sh
XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/gf-wayland weston --backend=headless --renderer=pixman \
  --width=1280 --height=800 --xwayland --no-config --socket=gf-wayland &
```

This guest tests aarch64 musl only. It does not establish glibc or x86-64
behaviour; CI's Ubuntu jobs cover those.
