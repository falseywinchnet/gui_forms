# Run it from the repository root in the toolchain shell that builds the
# project normally (on Windows the MSYS2 CLANG64 shell with LLVM 22.1.8;
# docs/building/index.md has the details). The first run configures the
# build directory; later runs rebuild incrementally. Extra arguments are
# passed to the first configure only. The defaults are the Windows native
# configuration; on Linux or macOS pass the host and Skia options that a
# normal build of that platform uses.
#
# The suite runs with ASan halting at its first report and UBSan reporting
# every finding without halting. A UBSan report therefore does not fail its
# test, so the script reads every test's output from ctest's LastTest.log
# and lists the reports itself. It exits non-zero when a test fails or when
# any sanitizer report appears. Rerun a test that fails only under parallel
# load on its own (ctest -R <name>) before treating it as a finding.
