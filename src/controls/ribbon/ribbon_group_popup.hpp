// The content of a collapsed group's popup (stage RB, phase 2b; owner
// decision 27): the group at its largest layout on a panel that casts the
// overlay shadow (decision 37). Private to the ribbon, which owns it, makes
// it on the first popup and disposes it with itself; `ribbon` observes the
// owner (house style §6: the back link does not extend its lifetime, and the
// ribbon closes the popup before it goes).
//
// An AnchoredPopupLayer places the content below the ribbon, its left edge
// at the ribbon's (near alignment), as wide as the ribbon's left edge to the
// panel's right edge; the panel sits at the group button's left within it,
// moved left only to stay inside the window. Outside the panel the content
// is transparent to input, so a click there reaches the layer and dismisses
// the popup. Interaction state lives in the ribbon: a command shows in the
// plane or in the popup, never both.
