    //   the thread holds it; WindowsAccessibility objects come and go with
    //   their windows and never release it.
    // - Lifetime: from that first provider until the thread exits; the
    //   apartment then ends with the thread, after every run on it. A run's
    //   own CoInitializeEx/CoUninitialize pair no longer ends the apartment.
    // - Why: UI Automation refuses a thread's providers
    //   (UiaReturnRawElementProvider answers E_INVALIDARG) once that thread's
    //   apartment has ended and begun again while a client still held an
    //   element. UiaDisconnectAllProviders before the apartment ended was
    //   not enough: it releases the providers UI Automation holds, but the
    //   refusal persisted in the next apartment (measured; see
