// Execution context: every ATK entry point is called by the AT-SPI bridge
// from the default GLib main context, which the host iterates on the UI
// thread (accessibility_dispatch and accessibility_wait). The semantic tree
// has one owner, that thread; nothing here is called from another thread.
//
// Identity: each published object is keyed by the runtime identity of the
// control that publishes it and, for a virtual child, the child's stable
// identity. Runtime identities are never reused, so an object a client
// still holds after its control is disposed or replaced is marked defunct,
// released, and refused by Window::perform_semantic_action (interview GF017).
