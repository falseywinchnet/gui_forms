// The material primitive's bake policy: the one place where the effort
// budget and the effort weights it is checked with are set (owner
// direction, 2026-10-22; in effort, not time, owner 2026-10-23).
//
// A part's raster is baked once, when it is rebuilt after an invalidation
// (a change of state, size, scale or theme), and then cached; compositing
// it afterwards costs a blit, plus a group blend where one applies, however
// complex the material. So a material's complexity costs only at bake time,
// and the bake is bounded so that no invalidation can stall: a material
// whose bake effort exceeds maximum_material_bake_effort is refused, the
// part is drawn by the built-in recipe instead, and the refusal is counted
// (Metrics::record_engine_primitive_refusal).
//
// Effort, not time (owner, 2026-10-23: "we should cure effort, not time"):
// the bake effort is the destination's device pixels (the part's box grown
// by the primitive's outsets) times the sum of the material's layers'
// effort weights, plus the rounded outer shadows' corner pixels times
// theirs. Weights and budget are dimensionless integers fixed in code, so
// a material is accepted or refused identically on every platform and
// every machine, however fast. Measurements choose only the weights'
// relative sizes (gui_forms_engine_material_tests --measure prints each
// layer kind's work relative to a solid layer's); no measurement, clock or
// duration decides acceptance.
