// An image face's sized variant (owner, 2026-10-22): stx_conv generates
// face sizes from the reference image as a preparation step, never inside a
// bake. The engine makes each variant once, here, keeps it in its shared
// cache (EnginePartTable), and lends it to the bakes that composite it.
//
// The resampling is the internal interpolation seam's, in binary64, over
// premultiplied colour in [0, 1], each axis on its own (the face study's
// choice, tools/resampler_face_study):
//
//   - shrinking an axis: pixel-area, each variant pixel integrating the
//     source it covers, so nothing aliases;
//   - enlarging an axis: the CONV interpolant evaluated at each variant
//     pixel's centre, mapped to source position (o + 0.5) × s / t − 0.5 and
//     clamped to the first and last source pixel;
//   - an axis of unchanged length is copied.
//
// The vertical axis goes first when the height shrinks, else the
// horizontal. A nine-patch's nine regions are resampled apart, each from
// its own source pixels, so its fixed corners and edges keep their pixels.
// The seam clamps each channel to [0, 1]; the colour channels are then
// clamped to alpha, keeping the colour premultiplied, and each channel is
// quantized once (to_byte).
