// The procedural patterns' generators (T2 plan, E10). A procedural fill is
// generated per display scale, never inside a paint: the engine queues its
// pattern when a bake first needs it, generates it in an idle frame, keeps
// it in its shared cache, and lends it to the bakes that composite it, as
// it does an image's sized variant (image_variant.hpp). Until it is
// ready, the fill draws its ground as a solid.
//
// Identical bytes on every host. The generators read only integers: each
// lattice value is a 32-bit hash of the seed and the cell (lowbias32,
// below), positions are 16.16 fixed point, and every blend is an integer
// weight in [0, 65536]. The doubles in a fill (tile, strength) are read
// once each, before the pixel loops, by one IEEE operation and a
// conversion, which every host rounds alike. No libm function is called.
//
// Per display scale, not resampled. A tiled pattern's tile is
// round(tile × scale) device pixels square, and its lattices have a whole
// number of cells across it, each a fixed number of logical units, so a
// pattern has the same features in logical units at every scale and each
// scale's tile is made from the lattice, not from another scale's pixels.
// Every lattice wraps at the tile's edges, so the tile repeats seamlessly.
// The fresco is made at the box's own device size instead.
