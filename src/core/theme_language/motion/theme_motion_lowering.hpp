// The motion lowering (stage T3, PLAN.md P7, section 1.8): CSS's
// `transition` and its four longhands, read from a rule's declarations,
// become the curves of the engine's presentational state machines
// (PropertyTransition); and, once every rule is lowered, each transition is
// grouped with the rules that refine its own (R2-18). `animation` and its
// longhands (P7b) play `@keyframes` once, as a machine state's entry
// value, stops and target, or as a loop, an expression of time_in_state
// under the rule's ambient effect. The compiler reads the values and
// handles the CSS-wide keywords; this lowers what is left into result
// records and reports nothing itself.
