// The theme compiler (stage T3, PLAN.md P5): a sheet's text in, the engine's
// rule records out. It runs the stages in order (tokenize, parse, collect
// the custom properties, then per style rule lower its selectors and its
// declarations) and lowers each declaration onto today's engine: the
// `primitive` a rule selects, that primitive's parameters by name, the
// presentational properties as one-state machines, `mix-blend-mode`, the
// material and recipe properties, transitions and animations. An `@media`
// block's rules are lowered once for each query, carrying its condition.
// The parser and the records between the stages stay internal (E3); the
// compiler is what the package loader (P9) and the tools call.

// - `source`: the sheet's name and text;
// - `registry`: the primitives the rules may select;
// - `vocabulary`: the control types, parts and states selectors may name;
// - `published_values`: the names the theme's manifest publishes (R2-06),
//   which `var()` reads and which become the sheet's published values;
// - `resources`: the resource names the manifest lists, for `url()`;
// - `images`: those that are images, bound to the engine's images (P10's
//   loader binds them; until then the caller does);
// - `requires_engine`: the engine version the manifest declares (P9
//   supplies it; until then the caller does);
// - `form`: a theme sheet, or a control's inline style (P9, R2-10), whose
//   rules are at the inline levels with the control's selector implied
//   and whose blocks may name only the control's own parts and states (the
//   vocabulary is the control's anatomy alone). An inline style has no
//   palette, custom properties (E999 until P12), at-rules or resources.
