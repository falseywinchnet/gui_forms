// Theme packages, the installed-pack index and `@import` closure (stage
// T3, PLAN.md P10, section 1.9, owner decisions D2 and those of 2026-10-28
// on theme.json).
//
// A package is its manifest's bytes and its files' bytes by path; nothing
// is read from a file system or a network. A package is verified whole
// before anything uses it: its manifest is read (theme_manifest.hpp);
// every file the manifest lists is present once and has its hash
// (file_hash_mismatch, E602, names the path, a resource's as well as the
// sheet's); a file it does not list, or one given twice, is
// manifest_invalid (E601); and the sheet's `@import`s are read, each one a
// theme the manifest's `imports` lists (else import_not_installed, E603).
// A verified pack's identity is the SHA-256 of its manifest's bytes.
//
// The installed index holds verified packs by name. An `@import` resolves
// only there: a name not installed is E603, an installed pack whose
// identity is not the importer's pin is import_hash_mismatch (E604), a
// pack importing itself through any chain is import_cycle (E605), and
// more than maximum_imports packs over the whole closure is
// too_many_imports (E506, R2-20). Each installed theme enters a closure
// once, the first time it is reached, and each pack comes after every
// pack it imports, as CSS places an imported sheet's rules before the
// importing sheet's.
