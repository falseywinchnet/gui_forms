# Third-party notices

GUI.Forms is MIT-licensed (`LICENSE`). Its program packages and its
installed SDK also carry, or statically embed, the third-party components
below. Each is listed with its version or pinned revision, the licence
GUI.Forms uses it under, the platforms it ships on, and where its licence
text is: under `licenses/` in a program package (on macOS,
`Contents/Resources/licenses/`), and under `share/licenses/GUIForms/` in the
installed SDK. Fonts carry their licences beside them in `fonts/`.

This list was audited from the build on 2026-10-21: the link lines of the
packaged programs, `packaging/licenses.json`, the CMake install rules, the
fonts' `ATTRIBUTION.md`, the Unicode data provenance and the provenance
records of the vendored sources. `tools/package_programs.py` checks every
program package against it (see the end of this file).

## FreeType

FreeType is used under the FreeType License (FTL), which GUI.Forms elects
from FreeType's dual licence (the FTL or the GNU GPL version 2). No GPL
licence text is shipped.

Portions of this software are copyright © 2026 The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved.

(2026 is the release year of the pinned FreeType 2.14.2, 2026-03-01; its
source files carry "Copyright (C) 1996-2025".)

## Not shipped

- libunibreak 8.0 (`28a2756b`): linked only by the development text-mask
  profile (`GUI_FORMS_BUILD_TEXT_MASKS`), which is never installed or
  packaged.
- System libraries a program loads from the operating system and that
  GUI.Forms does not distribute: on Linux, the C and C++ runtimes, X11 and
  the ATK/AT-SPI bridge (LGPL 2.1 or later, dynamically linked); on macOS,
  the system frameworks; on Windows, the system DLLs.

## Note on the MinGW-w64 runtime licence

The MinGW-w64 runtime's COPYING also reproduces the LGPL 2.1 notice of
header and IDL files imported from Wine. The Windows build was checked on
2026-10-21 for what of those files reaches a binary:

- Ten such headers are included by GUI.Forms objects (`uiautomation.h`,
  `uiautomationclient.h`, `uiautomationcore.h`, `uiautomationcoreapi.h`,
  `msxml.h`, `wincodec.h`, `dcommon.h`, `dxgiformat.h`, `exdisp.h` and
  `objectarray.h`, the last six generated from Wine IDL files), by 91
  objects, found from the build's header dependencies (`ninja -t deps`).
  `wincodec.h` was the Windows host's WIC PNG decoder, which Z-stage I2
  removed the same day; it is no longer included, so the list now has nine.
- No function from them is compiled into an object: every code symbol the
  91 objects define (`llvm-nm --defined-only`) is GUI.Forms', HarfBuzz's,
  FreeType's, the C++ runtime's or a test's. Besides code, the objects hold
  the compiler's type-information records for the COM interfaces those
  headers declare, and references to interface identifiers.
- The interface identifiers (16-byte GUID constants) come from MinGW-w64's
  `libuuid.a` (`uuid.o`, under the runtime licence above), whose values those
  headers declare. The Windows Gallery links 1,821 of them.

## The packaging check

`tools/package_programs.py` fails a program package when:

- this file is missing from its `licenses/`, or lacks the FreeType credit
  above;
- a licence file in the package (under `licenses/`, or a font licence in
  `fonts/`) is not named in this file, or a `packaging/licenses.json` entry
  names a component this table lacks;
- any file in the package carries a GNU General Public License text (its
  title in capitals, as every GPL, LGPL and AGPL text begins), or a file
  name contains "GPL".
